 A.I.  Artificial   Intelligence  (also known as  A.I. ) is a 2001 American  science fiction   drama film  directed by  Steven Spielberg . The screenplay by Spielberg and screen story by  Ian Watson  were loosely based on the 1969 short story " Supertoys Last All Summer Long " by  Brian Aldiss . The film was produced by  Kathleen Kennedy , Spielberg and  Bonnie Curtis . It stars  Haley Joel Osment ,  Jude Law ,  Frances O'Connor ,  Brendan Gleeson  and  William Hurt . Set in a futuristic post- climate change  society,  A.I.  tells the story of David (Osment), a childlike  android  uniquely programmed with the ability to love.
 Development of  A.I.  originally began with producer-director  Stanley Kubrick , after he acquired the rights to Aldiss' story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid-1990s, including Brian Aldiss,  Bob Shaw , Ian Watson, and  Sara Maitland . The film languished in protracted  development  for years, partly because Kubrick felt  computer-generated imagery  was not advanced enough to create the David character, whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed  A.I.  to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick's death in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson's  film treatment  for the screenplay.
 The film received positive reviews, and grossed approximately $235 million. The film was nominated for two  Academy Awards  at the  74th Academy Awards , for  Best Visual Effects  and  Best Original Score  (by  John Williams ).
 In a 2016  BBC  poll of 177 critics around the world, Steven Spielberg's  A.I.  Artificial   Intelligence  was voted the eighty-third-greatest film since 2000. [3]   A.I.  is dedicated to Stanley Kubrick.

 Plot [ edit ] 
 In the 22nd century,  rising sea levels  from  global warming  have wiped out coastal cities, reducing the world's population. Mecha, humanoid robots seemingly capable of complex thought but lacking in emotions, have been created. In  Madison, New Jersey , David, a prototype Mecha child capable of experiencing love, is given to Henry Swinton and his wife Monica, whose son Martin contracted a rare disease and has been placed in  suspended animation . Monica feels uneasy with David, but eventually warms to him and activates his  imprinting  protocol, causing him to have an enduring childlike love for her. David seeks to have Monica express the same love towards him. David is befriended by Teddy, a robotic teddy bear which belonged to Martin. Martin is unexpectedly cured of his disease and brought home. Martin becomes jealous of David, and taunts him to perform worrisome acts, such as cutting off locks of Monica's hair while she is sleeping. At a pool party, one of Martin's friends pokes David with a knife, triggering his self-protection programming. David grabs onto Martin, and they both fall into the pool. Martin is saved before he drowns, and Henry convinces Monica to return David to his creators to be destroyed. On the way there, Monica has a change of heart and spares David from destruction by leaving him in the woods. With Teddy as his only accompaniment, David recalls  The Adventures of Pinocchio  and decides to find the  Blue Fairy  so that she may turn him into a real boy, which he believes will win back Monica's love.
 David and Teddy are captured by a Flesh Fair, where obsolete Mecha are destroyed before jeering crowds. David is nearly destroyed himself and pleads for his life. The audience, deceived by David's realistic nature, revolts and allows David to escape alongside Gigolo Joe, a male prostitute Mecha on the run from authorities after being charged with murder. David, Teddy and Joe go to the decadent  resort town  of Rouge City, where "Dr. Know", a  holographic  answer engine, directs them to the top of  Rockefeller Center  in the flooded ruins of  Manhattan  and has also provided fairy tale information interpreted by David as suggesting that a Blue Fairy has the power to help him. Above the ruins of Manhattan, David meets Professor Hobby, his creator, who tells him that their meeting demonstrates David's ability to love and desire. David finds many copies of himself, including a female variant Darlene, boxed and ready to be shipped. Disheartened by his lost sense of individuality, David attempts suicide by falling from a skyscraper into the ocean. While underwater, David catches sight of a figure resembling the Blue Fairy before Joe rescues him in an amphibious aircraft. Before David can explain, Joe is captured via  electromagnet  by authorities. David and Teddy take control of the aircraft to see the Fairy, which turns out to be a statue from an attraction on  Coney Island . The two become trapped when the  Wonder Wheel  falls on their vehicle. Believing the Blue Fairy to be real, David asks the statue to turn him into a real boy, and repeats this request until his internal power source is depleted.
 Two thousand years later, humans are extinct and  Manhattan  is buried under glacial ice. The Mecha have evolved into an advanced form called Specialists, and have become interested in learning about humanity. They find and revive David and Teddy. David walks to the frozen Blue Fairy statue, which collapses when he touches it. The Specialists reconstruct the Swinton family home from David's memories and explain to him, via an interactive image of the Blue Fairy, that it is impossible to make David a real boy. However, at David's insistence, they recreate Monica through genetic material from the strand of hair that Teddy kept. This Monica can live for only one day, and the process cannot be repeated. David spends his happiest day with Monica, and as she falls asleep in the evening, she tells David that she has always loved him: "the everlasting moment he had been waiting for", the narrator says. David falls asleep as well and goes to that place "where dreams are born".

 Production [ edit ] 
 Development [ edit ] 
 Kubrick began development on an adaptation of " Super-Toys Last All Summer Long " in the late 1970s, hiring the story's author, Brian Aldiss, to write a  film treatment . In 1985, Kubrick asked Steven Spielberg to direct the film, with Kubrick producing. [6]   Warner Bros.  agreed to co-finance  A.I.  and cover distribution duties. [7]  The film labored in  development hell , and Aldiss was fired by Kubrick over creative differences in 1989. [8]   Bob Shaw  briefly served as writer, leaving after six weeks due to Kubrick's demanding work schedule, and  Ian Watson  was hired as the new writer in March 1990. Aldiss later remarked, "Not only did the bastard fire me, he hired my enemy [Watson] instead." Kubrick handed Watson  The Adventures of Pinocchio  for inspiration, calling  A.I.  "a  picaresque  robot version of  Pinocchio ". [7] [9] [10] 
 Three weeks later, Watson gave Kubrick his first story treatment, and concluded his work on  A.I.  in May 1991 with another treatment of 90 pages. Gigolo Joe was originally conceived as a  G.I.  Mecha, but Watson suggested changing him to a male prostitute. Kubrick joked, "I guess we lost the  kiddie market ." [7]  Meanwhile, Kubrick dropped  A.I.  to work on a film adaptation of  Wartime Lies , feeling  computer animation  was not advanced enough to create the David character. However, after the release of Spielberg's  Jurassic Park , with its innovative computer-generated imagery, it was announced in November 1993 that production of  A.I.  would begin in 1994. [11]   Dennis Muren  and Ned Gorman, who worked on  Jurassic Park , became  visual effects supervisors , [8]  but Kubrick was displeased with their  previsualization , and with the expense of hiring  Industrial Light & Magic . [12] 
 
 
 "Stanley [Kubrick] showed Steven [Spielberg] 650 drawings which he had, and the script and the story, everything. Stanley said, 'Look, why don't you direct it and I'll produce it.' Steven was almost in shock." 
 – Producer Jan Harlan, on Spielberg's first meeting with Kubrick about  A.I. [13] 
 
 
 Pre-production [ edit ] 
 In early 1994, the film was in  pre-production  with  Christopher "Fangorn" Baker  as  concept artist , and  Sara Maitland  assisting on the story, which gave it "a feminist fairy-tale focus". [7]  Maitland said that Kubrick never referred to the film as  A.I. , but as  Pinocchio . [12]   Chris Cunningham  became the new visual effects supervisor. Some of his unproduced work for  A.I.  can be seen on the DVD,  The Work of Director Chris Cunningham . [14]  Aside from considering computer animation, Kubrick also had  Joseph Mazzello  do a  screen test  for the lead role. [12]  Cunningham helped assemble a series of "little robot-type humans" for the David character. "We tried to construct a little boy with a movable rubber face to see whether we could make it look appealing," producer  Jan Harlan  reflected. "But it was a total failure, it looked awful."  Hans Moravec  was brought in as a technical consultant. [12] 
Meanwhile, Kubrick and Harlan thought  A.I.  would be closer to Steven Spielberg's sensibilities as director. [15] [16]  Kubrick handed the position to Spielberg in 1995, but Spielberg chose to direct other projects, and convinced Kubrick to remain as director. [13] [17]  The film was put on hold due to Kubrick's commitment to  Eyes Wide Shut  (1999). [18]  After the filmmaker's death in March 1999, Harlan and  Christiane Kubrick  approached Spielberg to take over the director's position. [19] [20]  By November 1999, Spielberg was writing the screenplay based on Watson's 90-page story treatment. It was his first solo screenplay credit since  Close Encounters of the Third Kind  (1977). [21]  Spielberg remained close to Watson's treatment, but removed various  sex scenes  with Gigolo Joe. [ citation needed ]  Pre-production was briefly halted during February 2000, because Spielberg pondered directing other projects, which were  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone ,  Minority Report , and  Memoirs of a Geisha . [18] [22]  The following month Spielberg announced that  A.I.  would be his next project, with  Minority Report  as a follow-up. [23]  When he decided to fast track  A.I. , Spielberg brought Chris Baker back as concept artist. [17]  Ian Watson reported that the final script was very faithful to Kubrick's vision, even the ending, which is normally attributed to Spielberg, saying, "The final 20 minutes are pretty close to what I wrote for Stanley, and what Stanley wanted, faithfully filmed by Spielberg without added schmaltz." [24] 
 
 Filming [ edit ] 
 The original start date was July 10, 2000, [16]  but filming was delayed until August. [25]  Aside from a couple of weeks shooting on location in  Oxbow Regional Park  in Oregon,  A.I.  was shot entirely using sound stages at Warner Bros. Studios and the  Spruce Goose Dome  in Long Beach, California. [26] 
Spielberg copied Kubrick's obsessively secretive approach to filmmaking by refusing to give the complete script to cast and crew, banning press from the set, and making actors sign confidentiality agreements. Social robotics expert  Cynthia Breazeal  served as technical consultant during production. [16] [27]  Costume designer  Bob Ringwood  studied pedestrians on the  Las Vegas Strip  for his influence on the Rouge City extras. [28] 
 
 Soundtrack [ edit ] 
 Main article:  A.I.  Artificial   Intelligence  (soundtrack) 
 The film's  soundtrack  was released by  Warner Sunset Records  in 2001. The original  score  was composed and conducted by  John Williams  and featured singers  Lara Fabian  on two songs and  Josh Groban  on one. The film's score also had a limited release as an official "For your consideration Academy Promo", as well as a complete score issue by La-La Land Records in 2015. [29]  The band  Ministry  appears in the film playing the song "What About Us?" (but the song does not appear on the official soundtrack album).
 
 Release [ edit ] 
 Marketing [ edit ] 
 Warner Bros. used an  alternate reality game  titled  The Beast  to promote the film. Over forty websites were created by Atomic Pictures in New York City (kept online at Cloudmakers.org) including the website for Cybertronics Corp. There were to be a series of video games for the  Xbox   video game console  that followed the storyline of  The Beast , but they went undeveloped. To avoid audiences mistaking  A.I.  for a  family film , no action figures were created, although  Hasbro  released a talking Teddy following the film's release in June 2001. [16] 
 A.I.  had its  premiere  at the  Venice Film Festival  in 2001. [30] 
 
 Home media [ edit ] 
 A.I.  Artificial   Intelligence  was released on  VHS  and  DVD  in the US by DreamWorks Home Entertainment on March 5, 2002 [31] [32]  in widescreen and full-screen 2-disc special editions featuring an extensive sixteen-part documentary detailing the film's development, production, music and visual effects. The bonus features also included interviews with  Haley Joel Osment ,  Jude Law ,  Frances O'Connor ,  Steven Spielberg , and  John Williams , two  teaser  trailers for the film's original theatrical release and an extensive photo gallery featuring production stills and  Stanley Kubrick 's original storyboards. [33]  It was released overseas by  Warner Home Video .
 The film was first released on  Blu-ray  Disc in Japan by  Warner Home Video  on December 22, 2010, followed shortly after with a U.S release by  Paramount Home Media Distribution  (former owners of the DreamWorks catalog) on April 5, 2011. This Blu-ray featured the film newly remastered in high-definition and incorporated all the bonus features previously included on the 2-disc special-edition DVD. [34] 
 
 Box office [ edit ] 
 The film opened in 3,242 theaters in the United States on June 29, 2001, earning $29,352,630 during its opening weekend.  A.I  went on to gross $78.62 million in US totals as well as $157.31 million in foreign countries, coming to a worldwide total of $235.93 million. [35] 
 
 Reception [ edit ] 
 Based on 193 reviews collected by  Rotten Tomatoes , 74% of critics gave the film positive notices with a score of 6.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "A curious, not always seamless, amalgamation of Kubrick's chilly bleakness and Spielberg's warm-hearted optimism.  A.I.  is, in a word, fascinating." [36]  By comparison,  Metacritic  collected an average score of 65, based on 32 reviews, which is considered favorable. [37] 
 Producer Jan Harlan stated that Kubrick "would have applauded" the final film, while Kubrick's widow  Christiane  also enjoyed  A.I . [38]  Brian Aldiss admired the film as well: "I thought what an inventive, intriguing, ingenious, involving film this was. There are flaws in it and I suppose I might have a personal quibble but it's so long since I wrote it." Of the film's ending, he wondered how it might have been had Kubrick directed the film: "That is one of the 'ifs' of film history—at least the ending indicates Spielberg adding some sugar to Kubrick's wine. The actual ending is overly sympathetic and moreover rather overtly engineered by a plot device that does not really bear credence. But it's a brilliant piece of film and of course it's a phenomenon because it contains the energies and talents of two brilliant filmmakers." [39]   Richard Corliss  heavily praised Spielberg's direction, as well as the cast and visual effects. [40] 
 Roger Ebert  gave the film three stars, saying that it was "wonderful and maddening." [41]  Ebert later gave the film four stars and added the film to his "Great Movies" list in 2011. [42] 
 Leonard Maltin , on the other hand, gives the film two stars out of four in his  Movie Guide , writing: "[The] intriguing story draws us in, thanks in part to Osment's exceptional performance, but takes several wrong turns; ultimately, it just doesn't work. Spielberg rewrote the adaptation Stanley Kubrick commissioned of the Brian Aldiss short story 'Super Toys Last All Summer Long'; [the] result is a curious and uncomfortable hybrid of Kubrick and Spielberg sensibilities." However, he calls John Williams' music score "striking".  Jonathan Rosenbaum  compared  A.I.  to  Solaris  (1972), and praised both "Kubrick for proposing that Spielberg direct the project and Spielberg for doing his utmost to respect Kubrick's intentions while making it a profoundly personal work." [43]  Film critic  Armond White , of the  New York Press , praised the film noting that "each part of David's journey through carnal and sexual universes into the final eschatological devastation becomes as profoundly philosophical and contemplative as anything by cinema's most thoughtful, speculative artists –  Borzage ,  Ozu ,  Demy ,  Tarkovsky ." [44]  Filmmaker  Billy Wilder  hailed  A.I.  as "the most underrated film of the past few years." [45]  When British filmmaker  Ken Russell  saw the film, he wept during the ending. [46] 
 Mick LaSalle  gave a largely negative review. " A.I.  exhibits all its creators' bad traits and none of the good. So we end up with the structureless, meandering, slow-motion endlessness of Kubrick combined with the fuzzy, cuddly mindlessness of Spielberg." Dubbing it Spielberg's "first boring movie", LaSalle also believed the robots at the end of the film were aliens, and compared Gigolo Joe to the "useless"  Jar Jar Binks , yet praised Robin Williams for his portrayal of a futuristic  Albert Einstein . [47] [ failed verification ]   Peter Travers  gave a mixed review, concluding "Spielberg cannot live up to Kubrick's darker side of the future." But he still put the film on his top ten list that year for best movies. [48]  David Denby in  The New Yorker  criticized  A.I.  for not adhering closely to his concept of the Pinocchio character. Spielberg responded to some of the criticisms of the film, stating that many of the "so called sentimental" elements of  A.I. , including the ending, were in fact Kubrick's and the darker elements were his own. [49]  However, Sara Maitland, who worked on the project with Kubrick in the 1990s, claimed that one of the reasons Kubrick never started production on  A.I.  was because he had a hard time making the ending work. [50]   James Berardinelli  found the film "consistently involving, with moments of near-brilliance, but far from a masterpiece. In fact, as the long-awaited 'collaboration' of Kubrick and Spielberg, it ranks as something of a disappointment." Of the film's highly debated finale, he claimed, "There is no doubt that the concluding 30 minutes are all Spielberg; the outstanding question is where Kubrick's vision left off and Spielberg's began." [51] 
 Screenwriter  Ian Watson  has speculated, "Worldwide,  A.I.  was very successful (and the 4th-highest earner of the year) but it didn't do quite so well in America, because the film, so I'm told, was too poetical and intellectual in general for American tastes. Plus, quite a few critics in America misunderstood the film, thinking for instance that the  Giacometti -style beings in the final 20 minutes were  aliens  (whereas they were robots of the future who had evolved themselves from the robots in the earlier part of the film) and also thinking that the final 20 minutes were a sentimental addition by Spielberg, whereas those scenes were exactly what I wrote for Stanley and exactly what he wanted, filmed faithfully by Spielberg." [52]  [Despite Mr. Watson's reference to worldwide box office of 4th, the movie actually finished 16th worldwide among 2001 movie releases.] [53] 
 In 2002, Spielberg told film critic  Joe Leydon  that "People pretend to think they know Stanley Kubrick, and think they know me, when most of them don't know either of us". "And what's really funny about that is, all the parts of  A.I.  that people assume were Stanley's were mine. And all the parts of  A.I.  that people accuse me of sweetening and softening and sentimentalizing were all Stanley's. The teddy bear was Stanley's. The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley's. The whole first 35, 40 minutes of the film—all the stuff in the house—was word for word, from Stanley's screenplay. This was Stanley's vision." "Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up. But I could see why. Because, obviously, I've done a lot of movies where people have cried and have been sentimental. And I've been accused of sentimentalizing hard-core material. But in fact it was Stanley who did the sweetest parts of  A.I. , not me. I'm the guy who did the dark center of the movie, with the Flesh Fair and everything else. That's why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place. He said, 'This is much closer to your sensibilities than my own. ' " [54]  He also added: "While there was divisiveness when A.I. came out, I felt that I had achieved Stanley’s wishes, or goals." [55] 
 Upon rewatching the film many years after its release, BBC film critic  Mark Kermode  apologized to Spielberg in an interview in January 2013 for "getting it wrong" on the film when he first viewed it in 2001. He now believes the film to be Spielberg's "enduring masterpiece". [56]
