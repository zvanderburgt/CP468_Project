once you find and set that up you can move on to step 2  Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 2: Start Making the AI now that you have your voice recognition you have to make you Intel 
you have to have a mic to do this step but record what you would want the computer to say to you 
save it on you desktop as what you would ask the computer Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 3: Fine Tuning drag the file onto the start menu  
and your done 
now to activate your ai you just have to open your voice reconition 
and say "start menu...(the name of your file)" and it will play you the recording

                 Reply Upvote This really isn't an Artificial Intelligence, but I do actually know how to make one. It's quite simple actually. Just download the whole internet as it's personality and there you go, you have an AI. Just don't steal my idea guys.

                 Reply Upvote I've studied quantum physics, engineering, and computer science for ten years now and downloading the whole internet is dangerous and requires an insane amount of storage space. I've made slightly larger working arc reactors to power humanoid robots that I 3D printed. And if you could download the hole internet you could not just simply upload it into a personality, you must program a code to interpret the information to be intergraded as a "personality". I own a company that does research in AI, we made a true AI from scanning the human brain then generating code to decode the brains information and a code for how information is processed into thoughts, emotions and feelings. With all this code and processing needs you can't just run it on a conventional computer, you need to build a cluster supercomputer. For my AI I bought 65 raspberry Pi 3's and joined them together. For storage I bought five, four terabyte external hard drives. As for the iron man suit, I took a look into this a few months ago and to make the thing at the cheapest it would cost around $4.2 Million USD and it would be very bulky. To make the suit as compact as Tony's you need to design all new circuit boards and would coast about $12.9 Million USD, and that's if you get everything right the first time and with such an advanced suit there will most definitely be error.           0 MaterialSmith Physics_tech749

                 Reply Upvote I'm not really concerned about a body for an AI I just want to know how to build one. So on that case how would one "scan the human brain then generate code to decode the brains information and a code for how information is processed into thoughts, emotions and feelings." I would really appreciate help from anyone because I'm interested in these things  0 YoutubeBin MaterialSmith

                 Reply Upvote Greetings. If you are reading this, please contact me on discord: Bin#4027 . I was working on one AI that would 100% work independend after connecting it into human brain. All tho I don't continue project anymore, I have got some files about it in my archives. Be aware that a lot in it is about how blood works to make "bio compoments" and artificial cells to make brain keep runing. S O M E. 0 Calex360 Physics_tech749

                 Reply Upvote hey I don't know if your for reals but if so just know that building a computer is a good start BUT when it comes to programing it has nothing to do with putting hardware together what you wanna start learning is java scripting maybe start with making an event listener for media or something and from there it should become alil more clear what i ment and such also an AI computer would be great but you may have to have a quantum computer to make that program or at least i would think so though don't worry to much sense recently they learned how to make a quantum computer run at room temperature rather than at 0 degrees so it should become more publicly accessible soon I'm hoping oh an one more thing for you to make that "computer AI" possible you will have to learn how to create an OS(operating System) for example Linux or Windows or Apple  0 Physics_tech749 talence

                 Reply Upvote If you are aimed to be the first person to create the first AI, I'm sorry to tell you its been done before. But if you want to create an AI a good way to get some bases of how to do so, base it off of IBM Watson. 0 CoderL CristinaL8

                 Reply Upvote Well that's nice and all but you're clearly lying. One cannot simply download the entire internet - there's no storage medium on earth large enough. And that wouldn't create a personality; you actually need to program to make an AI. If you did use the internet as a template for personality, your AI would be an overly-sexual weeaboo jerk. That's basically the internet summed up. I myself have a low-level AI which is about a step below Cortana or Siri. My AI is capable of responding to some phrases and running certain commands, but unfortunately not many commands and isn't able to converse. If I took a leaf out of Cleverbot's book, it would be able to converse, but would be random and idiotic compared to a human. 0 Physics_tech749 CoderL

                 Reply Upvote I like how you summed up the internet. I have built AI's with a whole personality code based off the human brain and instead of doing a lot of coding have a information processing code that has a simple bases of human interaction and knowledge according to personality bases and just teach the AI. 0 Sohum5 CoderL
