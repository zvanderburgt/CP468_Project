 Storyline 
 
 
     In the not-so-far future the polar ice caps have melted and the resulting rise of the ocean waters has drowned all the coastal cities of the world. Withdrawn to the interior of the continents, the human race keeps advancing, reaching the point of creating realistic robots (called mechas) to serve them. One of the mecha-producing companies builds David, an artificial kid which is the first to have real feelings, especially a never-ending love for his "mother", Monica. Monica is the woman who adopted him as a substitute for her real son, who remains in cryo-stasis, stricken by an incurable disease. David is living happily with Monica and her husband, but when their real son returns home after a cure is discovered, his life changes dramatically.

DIANE FLETCHER Covert Information Retrieval ... RED KING  These are characters from the AI alternate-reality game that was connected to the release of the film, and was played over the Internet. Several of the TV and cinema trailers for AI contained clues for game players, including the name Jeanine Salla listed in the credits at the end of the first trailer. This was the way into the game. The room number given in Claude Gilbert's credit is a further clue to game players.         See more   »
     
 
 
 Alternate Versions 
For the U.S. theatrical release, the Warner Bros. logo appeared before the Dreamworks logo at the beginning of the film, and the poster credits said, "Warner Bros. and Dreamworks Pictures present." Since the U.S. version's home video/DVD rights are owned by Dreamworks, the Dreamworks logo at the beginning of the movie appears before the Warner Bros. logo, and the back of the box's cover art says, "Dreamworks Pictures and Warner Bros. present."

 Steve's game 
 
                        24 October 2004 | by  fabiogaucho

 Artificial intelligence can be clearly divided in tow parts, quite different in mood and theme. The first hour imitates Staley Kubrick, who had worked on the project before his death. It is as if Spielberg is playing with Kubrick's fans: he films that part of the film exactly like the dead master would do it, reproducing very well that very disturbing mood from "full metal Jacket"'s first half, "A Clockwork Orange" and "Paths of Glory". It feels like a game. Spielberg knows that people could not this film and not ask: "I wonder how would Kubrick have done it", or start comparing the two to Spielberg's disadvantage. So he answers the question showing which film Kubrick would do in the 1st hour (the exact moment when the mom leaves the boy-robot), which proves his control over the medium (something no one ever questioned) and then moving on to HIS film, with the human content and theme he thinks he can provide (something you can easily question his ability).  Now he has to prove he can do a better job. So he extends and overfilms to the point of exhaustion his "vision", putting as much visual and emotion you could expect. Overall, it felt kind of boring and empty. So it's like "I gave you Kubrick and more! By the way, wasn't my vision more interesting?". No, it wasn't, Steve. You proved you are a talented director enough to bring to life a dead cinema master in a way we can almost believe he directed from the dead. But you proved, once more, that as an artist you can only be obvious and dull.
