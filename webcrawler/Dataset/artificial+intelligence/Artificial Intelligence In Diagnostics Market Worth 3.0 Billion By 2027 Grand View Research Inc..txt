 SAN FRANCISCO ,  July 29, 2020  /PRNewswire/ -- The global  artificial intelligence in diagnostics market  size is expected  to reach  USD 3.0 billion  by 2027, expanding at a CAGR of   32.3% , according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. Increase in the number of healthcare Artificial Intelligence (AI) diagnostic startups coupled with huge investments by venture capitalist firms to develop innovative technologies that allow fast and effective diagnostic procedures due to continuous increase in number of patients suffering from chronic diseases supports the growth of the market. Around 33.3% of all healthcare AI SaaS companies are engaged in developing diagnostics, making it largest focus area for startups in the market. 
 Growing investments and funding for AI in healthcare is also one of the key factors driving the market. For instance, in 2016, the U.S.-based startup, PathAI, secured  USD 75.2 million  investment for developing machine learning technology that assists pathologists in making more precise diagnosis. Rising investments in AI diagnosis-based startups is one of the key indicators that depicts upcoming opportunities. 
 Key suggestions from the report: 
 
 Software emerged as leading component segment in 2019 with a revenue share of 38.6% in the market   
 The neurology segment accounted for the largest revenue share in 2019, whereas radiology segment is projected to expand at fastest CAGR during the forecast period   
 North America  accounted for the largest share due to growing adoption of healthcare IT solutions in medical diagnosis and presence of well-established healthcare sector in the region.

According to National Cancer Centre and Riken, AI technology took 0.004 seconds to identify whether obtained endoscopic image contains normal stomach tissue or early stage cancer tissue. Growing awareness regarding the technology is expected to boost the usage of AI in medical procedures.
