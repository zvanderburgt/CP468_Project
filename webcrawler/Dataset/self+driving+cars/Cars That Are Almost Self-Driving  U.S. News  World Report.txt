 You Can’t Buy a  Self - Driving  Car, But These  Cars  Come Close 
 Despite some of the news headlines you might see, we’re still a few years away from a true  self - driving  vehicle. However, a lot of the technology that will get us there is already available.  Self - driving   cars , also known as autonomous  cars , are a goal of a lot of automakers and technology companies. You can’t buy one yet, but various levels of semi-autonomy are available. 
 If your car has features like blind spot monitoring or a rearview camera, you’ve already experienced some of the advancements that will eventually contribute to a full  self - driving  car. Features like lane departure warning and smart cruise control use complicated sensor networks to communicate with your car and help keep you safe.  Tesla  is one of the major forces in bringing such technology into the spotlight, but plenty of other automakers deserve credit for their innovations, too. 
 The Society of Automotive Engineers has classified  self - driving  vehicles into stages, which range from Level 0 to 5. Let’s take a brief look at each stage. Level 0 does not feature any  self - driving  tech at all. Level 1  cars  offer at least one system that helps the driver brake, steer, or accelerate, but if there are multiple systems, they are not capable of communicating with each other. Level 2  cars  can simultaneously control steering and speed, even if the driver is not  driving , for short periods of time. Think lane-centering technology combined with advanced cruise control, as an example. Level 3 vehicles are fully autonomous but require driver attention. These  cars  aren’t yet available but are being tested by some tech startups. Level 4  cars , once programmed to a destination, will not need driver input, but the controls are available should the driver wish to intervene. Level 5  cars  will be fully autonomous without any driver input whatsoever. 
 For more about the  levels of  self - driving   cars , click here . Keep reading to learn more about  cars  with semi-autonomous features.

 2019 Toyota RAV4 
 Price w/ Autonomous  Driving  Features: $25,650 | U.S. News Overall Score: 8.3/10 
 Toyota’s Safety Sense driver assistance package has been around for a while, but the 2019 model year marked the rollout of Safety Sense 2.0. The fully redesigned  RAV4  compact crossover is one of the best and most affordable vehicles you can get with this package, especially since it comes standard.  
 The Safety Sense 2.0 pre-collision system includes features such as pedestrian and cyclist detection with automatic emergency braking, road sign recognition, and lane tracing assist, which helps keep the RAV4 centered in your lane, even if the road curves.

 2019 Nissan Leaf 
 Price w/ Autonomous  Driving  Features: $34,800 | U.S. News Overall Score: N/A 
 The  Leaf  is Nissan’s electric compact car, and it’s long been a showcase for the brand’s latest tech features. ProPilot Assist, which is available with the optional Technology package in all but the base model and standard in the top trim, is the company’s semi-autonomous driver assistance package.  
 ProPilot Assist helps the Leaf steer, accelerate, and brake. Nissan emphasizes that it’s a hands-on system, meaning the driver is required to participate, but it can take some of the stress out of stop-and-go traffic thanks to front-facing cameras and sensors that keep pace with surrounding vehicles.

 2019 Tesla Model 3 
 Price w/ Autonomous  Driving  Features: $35,000 | U.S. News Overall Score: 8.7/10 
 A previous version of this list featured the  Tesla Model S , which is still one of the best-known semi-autonomous  cars  currently on the market, but the more recently introduced, smaller Model 3 has stolen some of its thunder, and is much more affordable. The price quoted above is the  Model 3 ’s base price, which includes features such as automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, and side collision warning. It also includes the Enhanced Autopilot system, which can steer, accelerate, brake, and even change lanes. 
 However, many shoppers will want to budget for the Full  Self - Driving  Capability system ($7,000), which includes features like  self -parking and summoning.

 2020 Volvo XC60 
 Price w/ Autonomous  Driving  Features: $40,795 | U.S. News Overall Score: 8.3/10 
 Volvo is known for its investment in new safety technology, going back decades, so it should be no surprise that this luxury compact SUV offers a ton of advanced features as standard equipment. The  XC60  can scan the road for imminent collision risks, including cyclists, pedestrians, and large animals, and can help brake or perform evasive maneuvers to avoid a crash. It’ll let you know if you’re getting too close to the vehicle ahead of you or if it suspects you’re not fully awake behind the wheel. The optional Pilot Assist system, which requires full driver attention and participation, can help accelerate, steer, and brake while traveling up to 80 mph.

Drivers are expected to remain alert and be able to take over as needed.

 2019 Audi A8 
 Price w/ Autonomous  Driving  Features: $91,695 | U.S. News Overall Score: 8.2/10 
 For 2019, the  Audi A8  large luxury sedan is fully redesigned and loaded with technology that wasn’t even approved for use across the country when the car went on sale.

 Budget-Friendly Tech Features 
 Though many of these well-equipped vehicles are on the expensive side, it’s possible to get some of these features for a lot less. For example, you can check out the Honda Sensing package, which is available on many  Hondas . In models that don’t include this package as standard equipment, you can expect to pay about $1,000. Features in this package include adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, and lane keep assist. 
 Subaru  is another company that offers up a lot of safety features as standard or affordable options. The  Crosstrek , one of Subaru’s most affordable models, offers the brand’s EyeSight package, which includes adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, emergency braking, and front and rear cameras.
