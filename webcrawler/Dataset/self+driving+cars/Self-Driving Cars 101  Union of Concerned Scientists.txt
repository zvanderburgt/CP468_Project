   Self - Driving   Cars  Explained 
 
 How do  self - driving   cars  work—and what do they mean for the future?

 Self - driving  vehicles are  cars  or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or “driverless”  cars , they combine sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle.

 Self - Driving   Cars  Are Coming


               
 
 Autonomous  cars  are coming. Test your knowledge on the future of driverless transportation.  
 
 
 
 
 Currently, there are no legally operating, fully-autonomous vehicles in the United States. There are, however,  partially -autonomous vehicles— cars  and trucks with varying amounts of  self -automation, from conventional  cars  with brake and lane assistance to highly-independent,  self - driving  prototypes. 
 Though still in its infancy,  self - driving  technology is becoming increasingly common and could radically transform our transportation system (and by extension, our economy and society). Based on automaker and technology company estimates, level 4  self - driving   cars  could be for sale in the next several years (see the callout box for details on autonomy levels). 
 
 
   
 Layers of autonomy 
 Different  cars  are capable of different levels of  self - driving , and are often described by researchers on a scale of 0-5. 
 Level 0 : All major systems are controlled by humans 
 Level 1:  Certain systems, such as cruise control or automatic braking, may be controlled by the car, one at a time 
 Level 2 : The car offers at least two simultaneous automated functions, like acceleration and steering, but requires humans for safe operation 
 Level 3 : The car can manage all safety-critical functions under certain conditions, but the driver is expected to take over when alerted 
 Level 4 : The car is fully-autonomous in some  driving  scenarios, though not all 
 Level 5 : The car is completely capable of  self - driving  in every situation 
 
 
 
   
 How they work 
 Various  self - driving  technologies have been developed by Google, Uber, Tesla, Nissan, and other major automakers, researchers, and technology companies. 
 While design details vary, most  self - driving  systems create and maintain an internal map of their surroundings, based on a wide array of sensors, like radar.  Uber’s   self - driving  prototypes use sixty-four laser beams, along with other sensors, to construct their internal map;  Google’s  prototypes have, at various stages, used lasers, radar, high-powered cameras, and sonar. 
 Software then processes those inputs, plots a path, and sends instructions to the vehicle’s “actuators,” which control acceleration, braking, and steering. Hard-coded rules, obstacle avoidance algorithms, predictive modeling, and “smart” object discrimination (ie, knowing the difference between a bicycle and a motorcycle) help the software follow traffic rules and navigate obstacles. 
 Partially-autonomous vehicles may require a human driver to intervene if the system encounters uncertainty; fully-autonomous vehicles may not even offer a steering wheel. 
 Self - driving   cars  can be further distinguished as being “connected” or not, indicating whether they can communicate with other vehicles and/or infrastructure, such as next generation traffic lights. Most prototypes do not currently have this capability.

  Revolution on the Road: The Shift to EVs and  Self - Driving   Cars 
 
 
 Vehicles expert Dr. Daniel Sperling walks us through the future of transportation and what is needed to make  self - driving   cars  an affordable, convenient, and efficient reality. 
 
 
 
 
 Impacts 
 The costs and benefits of  self - driving   cars  are still largely hypothetical. More information is needed to fully assess how they’ll impact drivers, the economy, equity, and environmental and public health. 
 Safety  is an overarching concern. Many thousands of people die in motor vehicle crashes every year in the United States (more than  30,000 in 2015 );  self - driving  vehicles could, hypothetically, reduce that number—software could prove to be less error-prone than humans—but cybersecurity is still a chief concern. 
 Equity  is another major consideration.  Self - driving  technology could help mobilize individuals who are unable to drive themselves, such as the elderly or disabled. But the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles could also displace millions of people employed as drivers, negatively impact public transportation funding, and perpetuate the current transportation system’s injustices. 
 Environmental  impacts are a serious concern, and a major uncertainty. Accessible, affordable, and convenient  self - driving   cars  could increase the total number of miles driven each year. If those vehicles are powered by gasoline, then transportation-related climate emissions could skyrocket. If, however, the vehicles are  electrified —and paired with a  clean electricity grid —then transportation emissions could drop, perhaps significantly. 
 To the extent that electrified  self - driving   cars  enable more shared rides (for example, through services such as Lyft or Uber), emissions could drop even further.   
 The Union of Concerned Scientists has worked on transportation-related policy issues for decades, and advocates for equitable, low-pollution vehicles, fuels, and infrastructure. In February 2017 we released a  policy brief that outlines the challenges and benefits of  self - driving  technology , and that includes seven principles for policy makers, companies, and other stakeholders to use as guides.  You can be involved .
