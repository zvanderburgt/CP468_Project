 quantum computer   Also found in:  Encyclopedia ,  Wikipedia .
		 
 quantum computer n.  A computer that exploits the quantum mechanical properties of subatomic particles to allow a single operation to act on a large amount of data. quantum computer     n    (Computer Science) a type of computer which uses the ability of quantum systems to be in many different states at once, thus allowing it to perform many different computations simultaneously

 A  quantum computer  uses quantum bits, or qubits, to process information in new ways. Seven basic questions about quantum technology, answered Physicists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have teleported a computer circuit instruction known as a quantum logic operation between two separated ions (electrically charged atoms), showcasing how  quantum computer  programs could carry out tasks in future large-scale quantum networks. Physicists 'Teleport' Logic Operation At a certain moment in time, the binary values of the n bits corresponding to a classical computer define a certain state for it, while in the case of a  quantum computer , at a certain moment in time, a number of n qubits have the possibility to define all the classical computer's states, therefore covering an exponential increased computational volume. FROM BITS TO QUBITS, FROM COMPUTING TO QUANTUM COMPUTING: AN EVOLUTION ON THE VERGE OF A REVOLUTION IN THE COMPUTING LANDSCAPE has launched ISARA Catalyst Agile Digital Certificate Technology, a first-of-its-kind technology that allows organizations and manufacturers to secure their infrastructure and connected devices from the looming threat of an encryption-breaking  quantum computer . ISARA LAUNCHES CATALYST AGILE DIGITAL CERTIFICATE ISARA Corp., the world's provider of agile quantum-safe security solutions, has announced the launch of ISARA Catalyst(TM) Agile Digital Certificate Technology, a first-of-its-kind technology that allows organizations and manufacturers to secure their infrastructure and connected devices from the looming threat of an encryption-breaking  quantum computer , the company said. ISARA introduces technology to ease transition to quantum-safe future This includes defining the base capabilities of a  quantum computer , and tests such as a suite of algorithms upon which, if somebody's machine can solve these problems efficiently, demonstrates a capability beyond what we currently believe to be classically possible. Quantum Information Science: Making the Leap: 'Extraordinarily important for our economic and national security' IBM has simulated the electronic structure of a small molecule, using a seven-qubit  quantum computer . MATERIALS' QUANTUM LEAP: Researchers recently used a quantum computer to model a simple molecule. That's just the start But until recently, that possibility has remained only theoretical, as no one has known how to build a  quantum computer , much less program one. Quantum Computing Moves Toward Reality Quantum computers  use quantum mechanics to solve mathematical problems in ways that conventional computers can't.The development ofa large-scale  quantum computer  could place many encryption systems at risk, according to the committee. Standards committee seeks computing, cryptography experts Last week I visited the same lab, where my hosts showed me the world's first  quantum computer  that can handle 50 quantum bits, or qubits, which it unveiled in November. Stranger Than Fiction! A quantum simulator is not a general-purpose  quantum computer , but one that is designed to solve a particular equation or simulate a specific problem. Quantum Simulator With 53 Qubits Sets Record
