 1960s [ edit ] 
 1960
 Stephen Wiesner  invents  conjugate coding . [1] 
 1970s [ edit ] 
 1970
 James Park  articulates the no-cloning theorem  [2] 
 1973
 Alexander Holevo  publishes a paper showing that  n   qubits  can carry more than  n  classical bits of information, but at most  n  classical bits are accessible (a result known as " Holevo's theorem " or "Holevo's bound"). 
 Charles H. Bennett  shows that computation can be done reversibly. [3] 
 1975
 R. P. Poplavskii  publishes "Thermodynamical models of information processing" (in Russian) [4]  which showed the computational infeasibility of simulating  quantum  systems on classical computers, due to the  superposition principle . 
 1976
 Polish mathematical physicist  Roman Stanisław Ingarden  publishes a seminal paper entitled " Quantum  Information Theory" in Reports on Mathematical Physics, vol. 10, 43–72, 1976. (The paper was submitted in 1975.) It is one of the first attempts at creating a  quantum  information theory , showing that  Shannon information theory  cannot directly be generalized to the  quantum  case, but rather that it is possible to construct a  quantum  information theory, which is a generalization of Shannon's theory, within the formalism of a generalized  quantum  mechanics of open systems and a generalized concept of observables (the so-called semi-observables). 
 1980s [ edit ] 
 1980
 Paul Benioff  describes the first  quantum  mechanical model of a computer. In this work, Benioff showed that a computer could operate under the laws of  quantum  mechanics by describing a Schrödinger equation description of  Turing machines , laying a foundation for further work in  quantum   computing . The paper  [5]  was submitted in June 1979 and published in April 1980. 
 Yuri Manin  briefly motivates the idea of  quantum   computing [6] 
 Tommaso Toffoli  introduces the reversible  Toffoli gate [7] , which, together with the  NOT  and  XOR  gates provides a universal set for reversible classical computation. 
 1980
 At the First Conference on the Physics of Computation, held at MIT in May,  Paul Benioff  and  Richard Feynman  give talks on  quantum   computing . Benioff's built on his earlier 1980 work showing that a computer can operate under the laws of  quantum  mechanics. The talk was titled “ Quantum  mechanical Hamiltonian models of discrete processes that erase their own histories: application to Turing machines”. [8]  In Feynman's talk, he observed that it appeared to be impossible to efficiently simulate an evolution of a  quantum  system on a classical computer, and he proposed a basic model for a  quantum  computer. [9] 
 1982
 Paul Benioff further develops his original model of a  quantum  mechanical Turing machine. [10]

 1984
 Charles Bennett  and  Gilles Brassard  employ Wiesner's conjugate coding for distribution of cryptographic keys. [13] 
 1985
 David Deutsch , at the University of Oxford, describes the first  universal  quantum  computer . Just as a  Universal Turing machine  can simulate any other Turing machine efficiently ( Church-Turing thesis ), so the universal  quantum  computer is able to simulate any other  quantum  computer with at most a  polynomial  slowdown. 
 1988
 Yoshihisa Yamamoto (scientist)  and K. Igeta propose the first physical realization of a  quantum  computer, including Feynman's CNOT gate. [14]  Their approach uses atoms and photons and is the progenitor of modern  quantum   computing  and networking protocols using photons to transmit qubits and atoms to perform two-qubit operations. 
 Gerard J. Milburn  proposes a  quantum -optical realization of a Fredkin gate. [15] 
 1989
 Bikas K. Chakrabarti  & collaborators from  Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics , Kolkata, propose  the idea that  quantum  fluctuations could help explore rugged energy landscapes by escaping from local minima of glassy systems having tall but thin barriers by tunneling (instead of climbing over using thermal excitations), suggesting the effectiveness of  quantum  annealing  over classical  simulated annealing . [16] [17] 
 1990s [ edit ] 
 1991
 Artur Ekert  at the University of Oxford, expands on the original proposal by  David Deutsch   [18] , for  entanglement -based secure communication. [19] 
 1992
 David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa propose a computational problem that can be solved efficiently with the determinist  Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm  on a  quantum  computer, but for which no deterministic classical algorithm is possible.  This was perhaps the earliest result in the  computational complexity  of  quantum  computers, proving that they were capable of performing  some  well-defined computational task more efficiently than any classical computer. 
 1993
 Dan Simon , at  Université de Montréal , invents an  oracle  problem for which a  quantum  computer would be  exponentially faster  than a conventional computer. This  algorithm  introduces the main ideas which were then developed in  Peter Shor's factorization algorithm . 
 1994
 Peter Shor , at AT&T's  Bell Labs  in  New Jersey , discovers an important algorithm. It allows a  quantum  computer to factor large integers quickly. It solves both the  factoring  problem and the  discrete log  problem.  Shor's algorithm  can theoretically break many of the  cryptosystems  in use today. Its invention sparked a tremendous interest in  quantum  computers.

 1995
 The first  United States Department of Defense  workshop on  quantum   computing  and  quantum  cryptography  is organized by  United States Army  physicists Charles M. Bowden,  Jonathan P. Dowling , and  Henry O. Everitt ; it takes place in February at the  University of Arizona  in  Tucson .

 1996
 Lov Grover , at Bell Labs, invents the  quantum  database search algorithm . The  quadratic  speedup is not as dramatic as the speedup for factoring, discrete logs, or physics simulations. However, the algorithm can be applied to a much wider variety of problems. Any problem that has to be solved by random, brute-force search, can take advantage of this quadratic speedup (in the number of search queries). 
 The  United States Government , particularly in a joint partnership of the Army Research Office (now part of the  Army Research Laboratory ) and the  National Security Agency , issues the first public call for research proposals in  quantum  information processing.

 1997
 David Cory ,  Amr Fahmy  and  Timothy Havel , and at the same time  Neil Gershenfeld  and  Isaac L. Chuang  at  MIT  publish the first papers realizing gates for  quantum  computers based on bulk nuclear spin resonance, or thermal ensembles. The technology is based on a  nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR) machine, which is similar to the medical  magnetic resonance imaging  machine.

 1999
 Samuel L. Braunstein  and collaborators show that none of the bulk NMR experiments performed to date contained any entanglement, the  quantum  states being too strongly mixed. This is seen as evidence that NMR computers would likely not yield a benefit over classical computers. It remains an open question, however, whether entanglement is necessary for  quantum  computational speedup. [30] 
 Gabriel Aeppli ,  Thomas Felix Rosenbaum  and colleagues demonstrate experimentally the basic concepts of  quantum  annealing  in a condensed matter system. 
 Yasunobu Nakamura  and  Jaw-Shen Tsai  demonstrate that a superconducting circuit can be used as a qubit. [31]  This leads to a global effort to develop  quantum  computers using superconducting circuits, culminating in Google's demonstration of  quantum  supremacy using this technology in 2019.

 2000
 Arun K. Pati  and  Samuel L. Braunstein  proved the  quantum  no-deleting theorem . This is dual to the no-cloning theorem which shows that one cannot delete a copy of an unknown qubit.

 16 January –  Quantum  physicists report the first direct splitting of one photon into three using  spontaneous parametric down-conversion  and which may have applications in  quantum  technology . [244] [245] 
 11 February –  Quantum  engineers report that they have created  artificial atoms  in  silicon   quantum  dots  for  quantum   computing  and that artificial atoms with a higher number of electrons can be more stable  qubits  than previously thought possible. Enabling  silicon-based  quantum  computers  may make it possible to reuse of manufacturing technology of "classical" modern-day computer chips among other advantages. [246] [247] 
 14 February –  Quantum  physicists develop a novel  single-photon source  which may allow to bridge semiconductor-based  quantum -computers that use photons by converting the state of an electron  spin  to the  polarisation  of a photon. They show that they can generate a single photon in a controlled way without the need for  randomly  formed  quantum  dots  or structural defects in a diamonds. [248] [249] 
 25 February – Scientists visualize a  quantum  measurement : by taking snapshots of ion states at different times of measurement via coupling of a trapped ion  qutrit  to the photon environment they show that the changes of the degrees of  superpositions  and therefore of  probabilities  of states after measurement happens gradually under the measurement influence. [250] [251] 
 2 March – Scientists report to have achieved repeated  quantum  nondemolition measurements  of an electron's  spin  in a silicon  quantum  dot : measurements that don't change the electron's spin in the process. [252] [253] 
 11 March –  Quantum  engineers report to have managed to control the nucleus of a single atom using only electric fields. This was first suggested to be possible in 1961 and may be used for silicon  quantum  computers  that use single-atom spins without needing oscillating magnetic fields which may be especially useful for  nanodevices , for precise sensors of electric and magnetic fields as well as for fundamental inquiries into  quantum  nature . [254] [255] 
 19 March – An US Army laboratory announces that its scientists analysed a  Rydberg sensor 's sensitivity to oscillating electric fields over an enormous range of frequencies—from 0 to 10^12 Hertz (the spectrum to 0.3mm wavelength). The Rydberg sensor may potentially be used detect communications signals as it could reliably detect signals over the entire spectrum and compare favourably with other established electric field sensor technologies, such as electro-optic crystals and dipole antenna-coupled passive electronics. [256] [257] 
 23 March – Researchers report that they have found a way to correct for  signal loss  in a prototype  quantum   node  that can catch, store and entangle bits of  quantum  information. Their concepts could be used for key components of  quantum  repeaters  in  quantum  networks  and extend their longest possible range. [258] [259] 
 15 April – Researchers demonstrate a proof-of-concept silicon  quantum  processor unit cell which works at 1.5 Kelvin – many times warmer than common  quantum  processors that are being developed. It may enable integrating classical control electronics with the  qubit  array and reduce costs substantially. The cooling requirements necessary for  quantum   computing  have been called one of the toughest roadblocks in the field. [260] [261] [262] [263] [264] [265] 
 16 April – Scientists prove the existence of the  Rashba effect  in bulk  perovskites . Previously researchers have hypothesized that the materials' extraordinary electronic, magnetic and optical properties – which make it a commonly used material  for solar cells  and  quantum  electronics  – are related to this effect which to date hasn't been proven to be present in the material. [266] [267] 
 8 May – Researchers report to have developed a proof-of-concept of a  quantum  radar  using  quantum  entanglement  and  microwaves  which may potentially be useful for the development of improved radar systems, security scanners and medical imaging systems. [268] [269] [270] 
 12 May – Researchers report to have developed a method to selectively manipulate a layered  manganite 's  correlated electrons'   spin  state while leaving its  orbital state  intact using  femtosecond   X-ray laser  pulses. This may indicate that  orbitronics  – using variations in the orientations of orbitals – may be used as the  basic unit of information  in novel IT devices. [271] [272] 
 19 May – Researchers report to have developed the first integrated silicon on-chip low-noise  single-photon source  compatible with large-scale  quantum  photonics . [273] [274] [275] [276] 
 11 June – Scientists report the generation of  rubidium   Bose–Einstein condensates  (BECs) in the  Cold Atom Laboratory  aboard the  International Space Station  under  microgravity  which could enable improved research of BECs and  quantum  mechanics , whose physics are scaled to macroscopic scales in BECs, support long-term investigations of  few-body physics , support the development of techniques for  atom-wave interferometry  and  atom lasers  and has verified the successful operation of the laboratory. [277] [278] [279] 
 15 June – Scientists report the development of the smallest  synthetic molecular motor , consisting of 12 atoms and a rotor of 4 atoms, shown to be capable of being powered by an electric current using an electron scanning microscope and moving even with very low amounts of energy due to  quantum  tunneling . [280] [281] [282] 
 17 June –  Quantum  scientists report the development of a system that entangles two photon  quantum  communication nodes  through a microwave cable that can send information inbetween without the photons ever being sent through, or occupying, the cable. On 12 June it was reported that they also, for the first time,  entangled  two  phonons  as well as erase information from their measurement after the measurement has been completed using  delayed-choice  quantum  erasure . [283] [284] [285] [286]
