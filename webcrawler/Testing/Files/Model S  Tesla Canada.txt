 Built for Safety 
 
 
 Model S is built for safety, with all-electric architecture designed to provide protection from every side—and one of the lowest rollover risks of any car on the road.

 Front-Impact Protection 
 There is no internal combustion engine in Model S, so the crumple zone has greater opportunity to minimize occupant deceleration in the event of frontal impact. 
 
 
 2 
 Side-Impact Protection 
 The combination of a high-strength central pillar and an energy-absorbing sill structure provides exceptional protection to both the occupant and the under-floor mounted battery pack. 
 
 
 3 
 Very Low Rollover Risk 
 The position and weight of the floor-mounted battery pack provides a very low center of gravity—allowing for a very low rollover risk.
