 As the auto industry enters a new decade, the onetime imminence of  self - driving   cars  gives way to a humbler reality: Major regulatory and technological hurdles remain before mass-market  cars  will schlep average folks around nationwide. Early last decade, experts  expected mass-market viability by 2025 . Now, a January 2020 report by the Victoria Transport Policy Institute predicts widespread, affordable autonomous vehicles won’t come  until the 2030s or 2040s .

 The good news? Some  self - driving  features can help ease the burden of your commute or road trip. No current production car in the U.S. can drive while you sleep, read or tweet, but many systems can maintain following distance with the vehicle ahead or keep your car centered in its lane — even down to a stop in bumper-to-bumper traffic, and in some cases without your holding the wheel. 
 Such capabilities have proliferated. When we began documenting  self - driving  features across the industry  in 2016 , only a handful of vehicles had lane-centering steering, and only some of those — mostly from Mercedes-Benz — did so from stop-and-go traffic up to highway speeds. Today, scores of models offer such full-range functionality, some as affordable as a base-model Toyota Corolla. A few BMWs and one Cadillac will even steer, accelerate and brake without your having to hold the wheel (provided a driver-facing camera intuits you’re paying attention). 
 Which  cars  have what? We simplified this list for 2020 to include the root nameplates only, so bear in mind that powertrain or body style variants — such as extended-length versions, or high-performance or hybrid variants — may also include the listed feature. In some cases, we singled out certain variants if the feature   is  exclusive  to them: For example, only the all-electric Kia Niro EV, not its gasoline counterpart, has lane-centering steering. But for the most part, we kept things at a high level. 
 Alphabetically by mass-market brand, here’s is the lay of the  self - driving  land. 
 Acura 
 Lane-centering steering at higher speeds only: 
 
 2020 Acura ILX 
 
 Adaptive cruise control down to a stop with lane-centering steering at higher speeds only: 
 
 2020 Acura MDX 
 2020 Acura RDX 
 2020 Acura TLX 
 
 Adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering, both down to a stop: 
 
 2020 Acura RLX 
 
 What should I look for? 
 Acura bundles most driver-assist tech under its AcuraWatch suite of features. Depending on the car, AcuraWatch includes a Lane Keeping Assist System, Adaptive Cruise Control with Low-Speed Follow, or both. Lane-centering steering via LKAS functions only from 45 mph and above, but the RLX adds Traffic Jam Assist, which incorporates lane-centering steering down to a stop.

 Alfa Romeo 
 Adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering, both down to a stop: 
 
 2020 Alfa Romeo Giulia 
 2020 Alfa Romeo Stelvio 
 
 What should I look for? 
 Adaptive Cruise Control Plus with Full Stop, plus two new lane-centering steering systems: Traffic Jam Assist and Highway Assist System. TJA works at speeds up to 37 mph. HAS functions at speeds up to 90 mph but only on GPS-intuited highways.

 Audi 
 Adaptive cruise control down to a stop and lane-centering steering at higher speeds only: 
 
 2020 Audi A3 
 
 Adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering, both down to a stop: 
 
 2020 Audi A4

 2020 Audi E-tron 
 2020 Audi Q3 
 2020 Audi Q5 
 2020 Audi Q7 
 2020 Audi Q8 
 
 What should I look for? 
 Terminology varies. Lane-centering steering comes by way of Traffic Jam Assist, which works at speeds up to around 40 mph. Active Lane Assist, a separate feature, works at speeds  above  roughly 40 mph. Characterized by Audi officials as lane centering, ALA is widely offered even on  cars  that lack TJA, like the A3. Further complicating matters, ALA is offered on Audi’s TT sports car, but it does  not  include lane-centering steering on that model. For adaptive cruise control, look for Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop and Go, sometimes simply called Adaptive Cruise Control or Adaptive Cruise Assist. It’s available on every model-year 2020 Audi model except the TT and R8.

 BMW 
 Adaptive cruise control down to a stop: 
 
 2020 BMW 2 Series 
 2020 BMW 4 Series 
 2020 BMW i3 
 2020 BMW X1 
 2020 BMW X2

 Adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering, both down to a stop, and hands-free steering at lower speeds: 
 
 2020 BMW 3 Series 
 2020 BMW 7 Series 
 2020 BMW 8 Series 
 2020 BMW X5 
 2020 BMW X6 
 2020 BMW X7 
 
 What should I look for? 
 BMW’s adaptive cruise control that operates all the way to a stop goes by Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go. One step beyond that, Active Lane Keeping Assist and Traffic Jam Assist (sometimes called  Assistant  for both) constitute hands-on, lane-centering steering that can work down to a stop in certain traffic conditions. Finally,  Extended Traffic Jam Assistant  is a proliferating feature available on some half a dozen models, all of them new or substantially updated, for 2020. ETJA enables hands-free  driving  on divided highways at speeds up to 40 mph as long as you’re paying attention, something the car intuits with a driver-facing camera; it makes BMW one of two brands on the U.S. market (the other is Cadillac) to offer provisional hands-free  driving . In our experience with ETJA, BMW’s system transitions to hands-on lane centering once you exceed 40 mph.

 Buick 
 Adaptive cruise control down to a stop: 
 
 2020 Buick Enclave 
 2020 Buick Encore GX

 2020 Cadillac XT5 
 2020 Cadillac XT6 
 
 Adaptive cruise control down to a stop and hands-free steering: 
 
 2020 Cadillac CT6  
 
 What should I look for? 
 Adaptive cruise control down to a stop comes in the form of Cadillac’s Adaptive Cruise Control-Advanced or, on the CT5, Advanced Adaptive Cruise Control. Hands-free lane centering, which works from a stop all the way up to highway speeds on certain highways, comes via Cadillac’s Super Cruise system. Introduced on the 2018 CT6, Super Cruise is no longer the only hands-free steering system in a U.S. production vehicle — BMW now offers the capability at low speeds — but it remains the only one that can do it all the way up to highway speeds. Super Cruise doesn’t relieve you of the need to pay attention and take over if necessary, something the system intuits through a driver-facing camera. Cadillac plans to expand Super Cruise to the 2021 CT4, CT5 and Escalade.

 Adaptive cruise control and lane centering steering, both down to a stop: 
 
 2020 Ford Edge 
 2020 Ford Escape 
 2020 Ford Explorer 
 
 What should I look for? 
 Look for Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop-and-Go, though some owner’s manuals carry simpler designations. Ford expanded lane centering down to a stop for 2020 — for 2019, it was only available on the Edge — for a combination system dubbed Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop-and-Go and Lane Centering, or Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control. The latter system includes both features. 
 Research Ford Vehicles 
 Genesis 
 Adaptive cruise control down to a stop: 
 
 2020 Genesis G70 
 2020 Genesis G80 
 
 Adaptive cruise control and lane centering, both down to a stop: 
 
 2020 Genesis G90 
 
 What should I look for? 
 Look for Smart Cruise Control with Stop & Go and Lane Keeping Assist. In our experience, LKA centers the vehicle above roughly 40 mph; Genesis called it lane centering  last year  but backed off such designations for 2020, although officials say the system hasn’t changed. It  “does a pretty good job of centering the car in the lane,” Genesis representatives told  Cars .com in an email, but “the intent of that feature is still at its root to be a lane departure prevention aid — not a driver convenience feature like LFA.” 
 LFA stands for Lane Following Assist, a feature that debuts in the refreshed G90 sedan. LFA keeps the vehicle centered at speeds up to 95 mph, while a new feature in the G90 called Highway  Driving  Assist works on “select interstate highways” to add automatic speed adjustment based on speed-limit signs.

 GMC 
 Adaptive cruise control down to a stop: 
 
 2020 GMC Acadia 
 2020 GMC Terrain 
 2020 GMC Sierra 1500

 2020 Honda Accord 
 2020 Honda Civic 
 2020 Honda Clarity 
 2020 Honda CR-V 
 2020 Honda Insight 
 
 What should I look for? 
 Honda bundles most driver-assist tech under its Honda Sensing suite of features. Depending on the car, Honda Sensing includes a lane-keeping assist system, adaptive cruise control with low-speed follow, or both. Note that half a dozen models — the Fit, HR-V, Odyssey, Passport, Pilot and Ridgeline — offer Honda Sensing with adaptive cruise control but  not  low-speed follow. In those vehicles, adaptive cruise control deactivates below 22 mph.

 2020 Hyundai Kona Electric 
 2020 Hyundai Elantra GT 
 2020 Hyundai Santa Fe

 Adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering, both down to a stop: 
 
 2020 Hyundai Ioniq 
 2020 Hyundai Nexo 
 2020 Hyundai Palisade 
 2020 Hyundai Sonata 
 
 What should I look for? 
 Depending on the car, Smart Cruise Control with Stop/Start or Smart Cruise Control with Stop & Go. Many such features are packaged into Hyundai’s SmartSense suite of safety and driver-assist features, though SmartSense contents will vary depending on the car. Lane-centering steering proliferates for 2020 — only the Nexo offered it in 2019 — in the form of Lane Following Assist, which can center the vehicle all the way down to a stop. An additional feature called Highway  Driving  Assist, offered on the Palisade, Ioniq and Sonata, adds traffic-sign recognition for automatic speed-limit adjustment on certain highways. 
 By contrast, Lane  Keep  Assist (sometimes Lane Keeping Assist) is a separate feature widely available across affiliated brands Hyundai, Kia and Genesis. Hyundai officials won’t call it lane centering, but in  Cars .com’s experience with various LKA-equipped  cars  from the three brands, LKA does center the car in its lane above moderate speeds. Different  cars  may have different setups, however, so test-drive them for yourself and see.

 2020 Infiniti Q60 
 
 Adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering, both down to a stop: 
 
 2020 Infiniti QX50 
 
 What should I look for? 
 Infiniti calls its adaptive cruise control with full-stop capabilities Intelligent Cruise Control with Full-Speed Range or some variation of that language. Lane-centering steering at higher speeds on the Q50 and Q60 goes by Active Lane Control, while Infiniti’s most robust system — which includes lane centering all the way down to a stop — comes in the QX50’s available ProPilot Assist.

 2020 Jaguar F-Pace 
 2020 Jaguar I-Pace 
 
 What should I look for? 
 Look for Queue Assist or Stop and Go, both used in conjunction with Jaguar’s adaptive cruise control. The feature constitutes adaptive cruise control down to a stop in slow-moving traffic; Stop and Go functionality automatically resumes if the car ahead starts moving within a few seconds. Lane-centering steering, meanwhile, goes by Steering Assist; it functions from a stop up to 112 mph. Don’t confuse Steering Assist with Lane Keep Assist. Despite going by a similar name as some competitors’ lane- centering  systems, Jaguar’s LKA is a separate, widely available system that only intervenes as you approach lane markings.

 What should I look for? 
 Smart Cruise Control with Stop & Go. On the K900, Niro EV and Telluride, lane-centering steering comes in the form of Lane Follow Assist. By contrast, Lane  Keep  Assist (sometimes Lane Keeping Assist) is a separate feature widely available across affiliated brands Hyundai, Kia and Genesis. Kia officials won’t call it lane centering, but in  Cars .com’s experience with various LKA-equipped  cars  from the three brands, LKA does center the car in its lane above a minimum speed (typically around 40 mph). Different  cars  may have different setups, however, so test-drive for yourself and see.

 Autopilot, Tesla’s wide-reaching semi-autonomous  driving  system. Although Tesla bills it as a hands-on-the-wheel system,  early versions  allowed you to drive hands-free for extended periods of time. The automaker has  since updated   Autopilot’s software on new  cars  and ones already on the road (via over-the-air software updates) to deactivate itself if it senses drivers’ hands are repeatedly off the wheel. Note that, since Tesla regularly updates significant aspects of its vehicles after you buy them, capabilities in the above  cars  may change as they’re on the road.

 Toyota 
 Adaptive cruise control down to a stop: 
 
 2020 Toyota Avalon 
 2020 Toyota Camry 
 2020 Toyota C-HR 
 2020 Toyota Prius 
 2020 Toyota Supra 
 
 Adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering, both down to stop:

 What should I look for? 
 Adaptive cruise control down to a stop comes through Toyota’s Full-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control, sometimes called Full-Speed  Range  Dynamic Radar Cruise Control or Dynamic Radar Cruise Control with full-speed range — the operative phrase, obviously, being “full-speed.” For lane-centering steering, look for Lane Tracing Assist or Lane Trace Assist, depending on the vehicle.

 More About the Systems 
 Myriad differences exist in the systems listed above, and performance varies widely. In our evaluations, some systems maintain fastidious lane centering and respond smoothly to changing traffic conditions. Others can allow significant wandering in your lane, react suddenly to changing traffic patterns or both. Varying conditions, from weather to road markings, can affect whether — and how well — each system works. It’s a good idea to download the owner’s manual of your prospective car to learn how its  self - driving  systems work, and ask a dealer specialist for a tutorial when you buy the car. And, of course, pay attention to the road.

 Adaptive Cruise Control Down to a Stop 
 This feature builds on basic adaptive cruise control, a  decades-old feature  that maintains a selectable distance between you and the car ahead. Adaptive cruise that works at  higher  speeds is widely available, but systems that function down to a full standstill are an important next step toward managing bumper-to-bumper traffic. Such systems can bring you to a full stop in traffic. Some require you to apply the brakes and reaccelerate afterward, while others can resume speed when the car ahead moves within a given timeframe. 
 Lane-Centering Steering 
 This goes beyond lane-departure steering assist, which intervenes only as you approach or cross the lane markings — and often pinballs you back toward the  opposite  markings — to actively center the vehicle in its lane by tracking lane markings, the vehicle ahead or some combination of the two. Such systems can often negotiate mild curves, as well, but nearly all of them require you to keep your hands on the wheel, issuing warnings and eventually deactivating if they sense a lack of steering force after a short time. Many lane-centering steering systems will also deactivate if lane markings disappear, which often occurs with construction zones, merging lanes or poorly marked roads. Some systems operate only above or below a certain speed threshold, but most modern systems now function from a stop all the way up to highway speeds. 
 Hands-Free Steering 
 This centers the car  without  your hands on the wheel. For 2020, only two systems — Cadillac’s Super Cruise and BMW’s Extended Traffic Jam Assistant — do this. Both require you to pay attention, intuited via driver-facing cameras. 
 Attention-Free  Driving 
 Conditional automated  driving , where your car putters along in specific situations and you  don’t  have to pay attention, was to come with Audi’s new  Traffic Jam Pilot , a feature made possible in low-speed traffic through some two dozen camera, radar, sonic and laser sensors on the brand’s flagship A8 sedan. (You’d have to be able to take over if the system determined that conditions required it, so you couldn’t, for example, take a nap.) But regulatory challenges  stymied the technology  for the U.S. market, so, as of now, the A8 — or any other Audi in the U.S., for that matter — does not offer TJP. As of yet, no production car in the U.S. has advanced to this point. 
 Editor’s note:  This story was updated March 12, 2020, to reflect that lane centering from Jaguar and Land Rover works down to a stop.
