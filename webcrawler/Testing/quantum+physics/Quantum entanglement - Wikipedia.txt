 Quantum  entanglement  is a physical phenomenon that occurs when a pair or group of  particles  is generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in a way such that the  quantum  state  of each particle of the pair or group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance.  The topic of  quantum  entanglement is at the heart of the  disparity between classical and  quantum   physics : entanglement is a primary feature of  quantum  mechanics lacking in classical mechanics.
 Measurements  of  physical properties  such as  position ,  momentum ,  spin , and  polarization  performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly  correlated . For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, will be found to be counterclockwise. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly  paradoxical  effects: any measurement of a property of a particle results in an irreversible  wave function collapse  of that particle and will change the original  quantum  state. In the case of entangled particles, such a measurement will affect the entangled system as a whole.
 Such phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by  Albert Einstein ,  Boris Podolsky , and  Nathan Rosen , [1]  and several papers by  Erwin Schrödinger  shortly thereafter, [2] [3]  describing what came to be known as the  EPR paradox . Einstein and others considered such behavior to be impossible, as it violated the  local realism  view of causality (Einstein referring to it as "spooky  action at a distance ") [4]  and argued that the accepted formulation of  quantum  mechanics  must therefore be incomplete.
 Later, however, the counterintuitive predictions of  quantum  mechanics were verified experimentally [5] [6] [7]  in tests in which polarization or spin of entangled particles were measured at separate locations, statistically violating  Bell's inequality . In earlier tests, it couldn't be absolutely ruled out that the test result at one point could have been  subtly transmitted  to the remote point, affecting the outcome at the second location. [7]  However, so-called "loophole-free" Bell tests have been performed in which the locations were separated such that communications at the speed of light would have taken longer—in one case 10,000 times longer—than the interval between the measurements. [6] [5] 
 According to  some   interpretations of  quantum  mechanics , the effect of one measurement occurs instantly. Other interpretations which don't recognize  wavefunction collapse  dispute that there is any "effect" at all. However, all interpretations agree that entanglement produces  correlation  between the measurements and that the  mutual information  between the entangled particles can be exploited, but that any  transmission  of information at faster-than-light speeds is impossible. [8] [9] 
 Quantum  entanglement has been demonstrated experimentally with  photons , [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16]   neutrinos , [17]   electrons , [18] [19]   molecules  as large as  buckyballs , [20] [21]  and even small diamonds. [22] [23]  The utilization of entanglement in  communication ,  computation  and  quantum  radar  is a very active area of research and development.

 History [ edit ] 
   Article headline regarding the  Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox  (EPR paradox) paper, in the May 4, 1935 issue of  The New York Times . 
 The counterintuitive predictions of  quantum  mechanics about strongly correlated systems were first discussed by  Albert Einstein  in 1935, in a joint paper with  Boris Podolsky  and  Nathan Rosen . [1] 
In this study, the three formulated the  Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox  (EPR paradox), a  thought experiment  that attempted to show that  quantum  mechanical theory  was  incomplete . They wrote: "We are thus forced to conclude that the  quantum -mechanical description of physical reality given by wave functions is not complete." [1] 
 However, the three scientists did not coin the word  entanglement , nor did they generalize the special properties of the state they considered. Following the EPR paper,  Erwin Schrödinger  wrote a letter to Einstein in  German  in which he used the word  Verschränkung  (translated by himself as  entanglement ) "to describe the correlations between two particles that interact and then separate, as in the EPR experiment." [24] 
 Schrödinger shortly thereafter published a seminal paper defining and discussing the notion of "entanglement." In the paper, he recognized the importance of the concept, and stated: [2]  "I would not call [entanglement]  one  but rather  the  characteristic trait of  quantum  mechanics , the one that enforces its entire departure from  classical  lines of thought."
 Like Einstein, Schrödinger was dissatisfied with the concept of entanglement, because it seemed to violate the speed limit on the transmission of information implicit in the  theory of relativity . [25]  Einstein later famously derided entanglement as " spukhafte Fernwirkung " [26]  or "spooky  action at a distance ."
 The EPR paper generated significant interest among physicists, which inspired much discussion about the foundations of  quantum  mechanics (perhaps most famously  Bohm's interpretation  of  quantum  mechanics), but produced relatively little other published work. Despite the interest, the weak point in EPR's argument was not discovered until 1964, when  John Stewart Bell  proved that one of their key assumptions, the  principle of locality , as applied to the kind of hidden variables interpretation hoped for by EPR, was mathematically inconsistent with the predictions of  quantum  theory.
 Specifically, Bell demonstrated an upper limit, seen in  Bell's inequality , regarding the strength of correlations that can be produced in any theory obeying  local realism , and showed that  quantum  theory predicts violations of this limit for certain entangled systems. [27]  His inequality is experimentally testable, and there have been numerous  relevant experiments , starting with the pioneering work of  Stuart Freedman  and  John Clauser  in 1972 [28]  and  Alain Aspect 's experiments in 1982. [29]  An early experimental breakthrough was due to Carl Kocher, [10] [11]  who already in 1967 presented an apparatus in which two photons successively emitted from a calcium atom were shown to be entangled – the first case of entangled visible light. The two photons passed diametrically positioned parallel polarizers with higher probability than classically predicted but with correlations in quantitative agreement with  quantum  mechanical calculations. He also showed that the correlation varied only upon (as cosine square of) the angle between the polarizer settings [11]  and decreased exponentially with time lag between emitted photons. [12]  Kocher’s apparatus, equipped with better polarizers, was used by Freedman and Clauser who could confirm the cosine square dependence and use it to demonstrate a violation of Bell’s inequality for a set of fixed angles. [28]  All these experiments have shown agreement with  quantum  mechanics rather than the principle of local realism.
 For decades, each had left open at least one  loophole  by which it was possible to question the validity of the results.  However, in 2015 an experiment was performed that simultaneously closed both the detection and locality loopholes, and was heralded as "loophole-free"; this experiment ruled out a large class of local realism theories with certainty. [30]   Alain Aspect  notes that the "setting-independence loophole" – which he refers to as "far-fetched", yet, a  "residual loophole" that "cannot be ignored" – has yet to be closed, and the free-will /  superdeterminism  loophole is unclosable; saying "no experiment, as ideal as it is, can be said to be totally loophole-free." [31] 
 A minority opinion holds that although  quantum  mechanics is correct, there is no  superluminal  instantaneous action-at-a-distance between entangled particles once the particles are separated. [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] 
 Bell's work raised the possibility of using these super-strong correlations as a resource for communication. It led to the 1984 discovery of  quantum  key distribution  protocols, most famously  BB84  by  Charles H. Bennett  and  Gilles Brassard [37]  and  E91  by  Artur Ekert . [38]  Although BB84 does not use entanglement, Ekert's protocol uses the violation of a Bell's inequality as a proof of security.
 
 Concept [ edit ] 
 Meaning of entanglement [ edit ] 
 An entangled system is defined to be one whose  quantum  state  cannot be factored as a product of states of its local constituents; that is to say, they are not individual particles but are an inseparable whole. In entanglement, one constituent cannot be fully described without considering the other(s). The state of a composite system is always expressible as a sum, or  superposition , of products of states of local constituents; it is entangled if this sum necessarily has more than one term.
 Quantum   systems  can become entangled through various types of interactions. For some ways in which entanglement may be achieved for experimental purposes, see the section below on  methods . Entanglement is broken when the entangled particles  decohere  through interaction with the environment; for example, when a measurement is made. [39] 
 As an example of entanglement: a  subatomic particle   decays  into an entangled pair of other particles. The decay events obey the various  conservation laws , and as a result, the measurement outcomes of one daughter particle must be highly correlated with the measurement outcomes of the other daughter particle (so that the total momenta, angular momenta, energy, and so forth remains roughly the same before and after this process). For instance, a  spin -zero particle could decay into a pair of spin-½ particles. Since the total spin before and after this decay must be zero (conservation of angular momentum), whenever the first particle is measured to be  spin up  on some axis, the other, when measured on the same axis, is always found to be  spin down . (This is called the spin anti-correlated case; and if the prior probabilities for measuring each spin are equal, the pair is said to be in the  singlet state .)
 The special property of entanglement can be better observed if we separate the said two particles. Let's put one of them in the White House in Washington and the other in Buckingham Palace (think about this as a thought experiment, not an actual one). Now, if we measure a particular characteristic of one of these particles (say, for example, spin), get a result, and then measure the other particle using the same criterion (spin along the same axis), we find that the result of the measurement of the second particle will match (in a complementary sense) the result of the measurement of the first particle, in that they will be opposite in their values.
 The above result may or may not be perceived as surprising. A classical system would display the same property, and a  hidden variable theory  (see below) would certainly be required to do so, based on conservation of angular momentum in classical and  quantum  mechanics alike. The difference is that a classical system has definite values for all the observables all along, while the  quantum  system does not. In a sense to be discussed below, the  quantum  system considered here seems to acquire a probability distribution for the outcome of a measurement of the spin along any axis of the other particle upon measurement of the first particle. This probability distribution is in general different from what it would be without measurement of the first particle. This may certainly be perceived as surprising in the case of spatially separated entangled particles.
 
 Paradox [ edit ] 
 The paradox is that a measurement made on either of the particles apparently collapses the state of the entire entangled system—and does so instantaneously, before any information about the measurement result could have been communicated to the other particle (assuming that information cannot travel  faster than light ) and hence assured the "proper" outcome of the measurement of the other part of the entangled pair. In the  Copenhagen interpretation , the result of a spin measurement on one of the particles is a collapse into a state in which each particle has a definite spin (either up or down) along the axis of measurement. The outcome is taken to be random, with each possibility having a probability of 50%. However, if both spins are measured along the same axis, they are found to be anti-correlated. This means that the random outcome of the measurement made on one particle seems to have been transmitted to the other, so that it can make the "right choice" when it too is measured. [40] 
 The distance and timing of the measurements can be chosen so as to make the interval between the two measurements  spacelike , hence, any causal effect connecting the events would have to travel faster than light. According to the principles of  special relativity , it is not possible for any information to travel between two such measuring events. It is not even possible to say which of the measurements came first. For two spacelike separated events  x 1  and  x 2  there are  inertial frames  in which  x 1  is first and others in which  x 2  is first. Therefore, the correlation between the two measurements cannot be explained as one measurement determining the other: different observers would disagree about the role of cause and effect.
 (In fact similar paradoxes can arise even without entanglement: the position of a single particle is spread out over space, and two widely separated detectors attempting to detect the particle in two different places must instantaneously attain appropriate correlation, so that they do not both detect the particle.)
 
 Hidden variables theory [ edit ] 
 A possible resolution to the paradox is to assume that  quantum  theory is incomplete, and the result of measurements depends on predetermined "hidden variables". [41]   The state of the particles being measured contains some  hidden variables , whose values effectively determine, right from the moment of separation, what the outcomes of the spin measurements are going to be. This would mean that each particle carries all the required information with it, and nothing needs to be transmitted from one particle to the other at the time of measurement. Einstein and others (see the previous section) originally believed  this was the only way out of the paradox, and the accepted  quantum  mechanical description (with a random measurement outcome) must be incomplete.
 
 Violations of Bell's inequality [ edit ] 
 Local hidden variable theories fail, however, when measurements of the spin of entangled particles along different axes are considered. If a large number of pairs of such measurements are made (on a large number of pairs of entangled particles), then statistically, if the  local realist  or hidden variables view were correct, the results would always satisfy  Bell's inequality . A  number of experiments  have shown in practice that Bell's inequality is not satisfied. However, prior to 2015, all of these had loophole problems that were considered the most important by the community of physicists. [42] [43]  When measurements of the entangled particles are made in moving  relativistic  reference frames, in which each measurement (in its own relativistic time frame) occurs before the other, the measurement results remain correlated. [44] [45] 
 The fundamental issue about measuring spin along different axes is that these measurements cannot have definite values at the same time―they are  incompatible  in the sense that these measurements' maximum simultaneous precision is constrained by the  uncertainty principle . This is contrary to what is found in classical  physics , where any number of properties can be measured simultaneously with arbitrary accuracy. It has been proven mathematically that compatible measurements cannot show Bell-inequality-violating correlations, [46]  and thus entanglement is a fundamentally non-classical phenomenon.
 
 Other types of experiments [ edit ] 
 In experiments in 2012 and 2013, polarization correlation was created between photons that never coexisted in time. [47] [48]  The authors claimed that this result was achieved by  entanglement swapping  between two pairs of entangled photons after measuring the polarization of one photon of the early pair, and that it proves that  quantum  non-locality applies not only to space but also to time.
 In three independent experiments in 2013 it was shown that  classically-communicated   separable  quantum  states  can be used to carry entangled states. [49]  The first loophole-free Bell test was held in TU Delft in 2015 confirming the violation of Bell inequality. [50] 
 In August 2014, Brazilian researcher Gabriela Barreto Lemos and team were able to "take pictures" of objects using photons that had not interacted with the subjects, but were entangled with photons that did interact with such objects. Lemos, from the University of Vienna, is confident that this new  quantum  imaging technique could find application where low light imaging is imperative, in fields like biological or medical imaging. [51] 
 In 2015, Markus Greiner's group at Harvard performed a direct measurement of Renyi entanglement in a system of ultracold bosonic atoms.
 From 2016 various companies like IBM, Microsoft etc. have successfully created  quantum  computers and allowed developers and tech enthusiasts to openly experiment with concepts of  quantum  mechanics including  quantum  entanglement. [52] 
 
 Mystery of time [ edit ] 
 There have been suggestions to look at the concept of time as an  emergent phenomenon  that is a side effect of  quantum  entanglement. [53] [54] 
In other words, time is an entanglement phenomenon, which places all equal clock readings (of correctly prepared clocks, or of any objects usable as clocks) into the same history. This was first fully theorized by  Don Page  and  William Wootters  in 1983. [55] 
The  Wheeler–DeWitt equation  that combines general relativity and  quantum  mechanics – by leaving out time altogether – was introduced in the 1960s and it was taken up again in 1983, when Page and Wootters made a solution based on  quantum  entanglement. Page and Wootters argued that entanglement can be used to measure time. [56] 
 In 2013, at the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRIM) in Turin, Italy, researchers performed the first experimental test of Page and Wootters' ideas. Their result has been interpreted to confirm that time is an emergent phenomenon for internal observers but absent for external observers of the universe just as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation predicts. [56] 
 
 Source for the arrow of time [ edit ] 
 Physicist  Seth Lloyd  says that  quantum  uncertainty  gives rise to entanglement, the putative source of the  arrow of time . According to Lloyd; "The arrow of time is an arrow of increasing correlations." [57]  The approach to entanglement would be from the perspective of the causal arrow of time, with the assumption that the cause of the measurement of one particle determines the effect of the result of the other particle's measurement.
 
 Emergent gravity [ edit ] 
 Based on  AdS/CFT correspondence ,  Mark Van Raamsdonk  suggested that spacetime arises as an emergent phenomenon of the  quantum  degrees of freedom that are entangled and live in the boundary of the space-time. [58]   Induced gravity  can emerge from the entanglement first law. [59] [60] 
 
 Non-locality and entanglement [ edit ] 
 In the media and popular science,  quantum  non-locality is often portrayed as being equivalent to entanglement. While this is true for pure bipartite  quantum  states, in general entanglement is only necessary for non-local correlations, but there exist mixed entangled states that do not produce such correlations. [61]  A well-known example is the  Werner states  that are entangled for certain values of  
 
 
 
 
 p

 {\displaystyle p_{sym}} 
 
 , but can always be described using local hidden variables. [62]  Moreover, it was shown that, for arbitrary numbers of parties, there exist states that are genuinely entangled but admit a local model. [63] 
The mentioned proofs about the existence of local models assume that there is only one copy of the  quantum  state available at a time. If the parties are allowed to perform local measurements on many copies of such states, then many apparently local states (e.g., the qubit Werner states) can no longer be described by a local model. This is, in particular, true for all  distillable  states. However, it remains an open question whether all entangled states become non-local given sufficiently many copies. [64] 
 In short, entanglement of a state shared by two parties is necessary but not sufficient for that state to be non-local. It is important to recognize that entanglement is more commonly viewed as an algebraic concept, noted for being a prerequisite to non-locality as well as to  quantum  teleportation  and to  superdense coding , whereas non-locality is defined according to experimental statistics and is much more involved with the  foundations  and  interpretations of  quantum  mechanics . [65] 
 
 Quantum  mechanical framework [ edit ] 
 The following subsections are for those with a good working knowledge of the formal, mathematical description of  quantum  mechanics , including familiarity with the formalism and theoretical framework developed in the articles:  bra–ket notation  and  mathematical formulation of  quantum  mechanics .

 . 
 
 
 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}\left(|0\rangle _{A}\otimes |1\rangle _{B}-|1\rangle _{A}\otimes |0\rangle _{B}\right).} 
 
 
 If the composite system is in this state, it is impossible to attribute to either system  A  or system  B  a definite  pure state . Another way to say this is that while the  von Neumann entropy  of the whole state is zero (as it is for any pure state), the entropy of the subsystems is greater than zero. In this sense, the systems are "entangled". This has specific empirical ramifications for interferometry. [66]  The above example is one of four  Bell states , which are (maximally) entangled pure states (pure states of the  H A  ⊗  H B  space, but which cannot be separated into pure states of each  H A  and  H B ).
 Now suppose Alice is an observer for system  A , and Bob is an observer for system  B . If in the entangled state given above Alice makes a measurement in the  
 
 
 
 
 { 
 
 | 
 
 0 
 ⟩  ⟩  
 , 
 
 | 
 
 1 
 ⟩  ⟩

 {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \{|0\rangle ,|1\rangle \}} 
 
  eigenbasis of  A , there are two possible outcomes, occurring with equal probability: [67] 
 
 Alice measures 0, and the state of the system collapses to  
 
 
 
 
 
 | 
 
 0 
 
 ⟩  ⟩  
 
 A 
 
 
 
 | 
 
 1 
 
 ⟩  ⟩  
 
 B 
 
 
 
 
 
 {\displaystyle \scriptstyle |0\rangle _{A}|1\rangle _{B}} 
 
 . 
 Alice measures 1, and the state of the system collapses to  
 
 
 
 
 
 | 
 
 1 
 
 ⟩  ⟩  
 
 A 
 
 
 
 | 
 
 0 
 
 ⟩  ⟩  
 
 B 
 
 
 
 
 
 {\displaystyle \scriptstyle |1\rangle _{A}|0\rangle _{B}} 
 
 . 
 If the former occurs, then any subsequent measurement performed by Bob, in the same basis, will always return 1. If the latter occurs, (Alice measures 1) then Bob's measurement will return 0 with certainty. Thus, system  B  has been altered by Alice performing a local measurement on system  A . This remains true even if the systems  A  and  B  are spatially separated. This is the foundation of the  EPR paradox .
 The outcome of Alice's measurement is random. Alice cannot decide which state to collapse the composite system into, and therefore cannot transmit information to Bob by acting on her system. Causality is thus preserved, in this particular scheme. For the general argument, see  no-communication theorem .
 
 Ensembles [ edit ] 
 As mentioned above, a state of a  quantum  system is given by a unit vector in a Hilbert space. More generally, if one has less information about the system, then one calls it an 'ensemble' and describes it by a  density matrix , which is a  positive-semidefinite matrix , or a  trace class  when the state space is infinite-dimensional, and has trace 1. Again, by the  spectral theorem , such a matrix takes the general form:
 
 
 
 
 
 ρ  ρ  
 = 
 
 ∑  ∑  
 
 i 
 
 
 
 w 
 
 i 
 
 
 
 | 
 
 
 α  α  
 
 i 
 
 
 ⟩  ⟩  
 ⟨  ⟨  
 
 α  α  
 
 i 
 
 
 
 | 
 
 , 
 
 
 {\displaystyle \rho =\sum _{i}w_{i}|\alpha _{i}\rangle \langle \alpha _{i}|,} 
 
 
 where the  w i  are positive-valued probabilities (they sum up to 1), the vectors   α i  are unit vectors, and in the infinite-dimensional case, we would take the closure of such states in the trace norm. We can interpret  ρ  as representing an ensemble where  w i  is the proportion of the ensemble whose states are  
 
 
 
 
 | 
 
 
 α  α  
 
 i 
 
 
 ⟩  ⟩  
 
 
 {\displaystyle |\alpha _{i}\rangle } 
 
 . When a mixed state has rank 1, it therefore describes a 'pure ensemble'. When there is less than total information about the state of a  quantum  system we need  density matrices  to represent the state.
 Experimentally, a mixed ensemble might be realized as follows. Consider a "black box" apparatus that spits  electrons  towards an observer. The electrons' Hilbert spaces are  identical . The apparatus might produce electrons that are all in the same state; in this case, the electrons received by the observer are then a pure ensemble. However, the apparatus could produce electrons in different states. For example, it could produce two populations of electrons: one with state  
 
 
 
 
 | 
 
 
 z 
 
 + 
 ⟩  ⟩  
 
 
 {\displaystyle |\mathbf {z} +\rangle } 
 
  with  spins  aligned in the positive  z  direction, and the other with state  
 
 
 
 
 | 
 
 
 y 
 
 −  −  
 ⟩  ⟩  
 
 
 {\displaystyle |\mathbf {y} -\rangle } 
 
  with spins aligned in the negative  y  direction. Generally, this is a mixed ensemble, as there can be any number of populations, each corresponding to a different state.
 Following the definition above, for a bipartite composite system, mixed states are just density matrices on  H A  ⊗  H B . That is, it has the general form

 Extending the definition of separability from the pure case, we say that a mixed state is separable if it can be written as [68] : 131–132 
 
 
 
 
 
 ρ  ρ

 where the  w i  are positively valued probabilities and the

 's and  
 
 
 
 
 ρ  ρ  
 
 i 
 
 
 B 
 
 
 
 
 {\displaystyle \rho _{i}^{B}} 
 
 's are themselves mixed states (density operators) on the subsystems  A  and  B  respectively. In other words, a state is separable if it is a probability distribution over uncorrelated states, or product states. By writing the density matrices as sums of pure ensembles and expanding, we may assume without loss of generality that  
 
 
 
 
 ρ  ρ  
 
 i 
 
 
 A 
 
 
 
 
 {\displaystyle \rho _{i}^{A}} 
 
  and  
 
 
 
 
 ρ  ρ  
 
 i 
 
 
 B 
 
 
 
 
 {\displaystyle \rho _{i}^{B}} 
 
  are themselves pure ensembles. A state is then said to be entangled if it is not separable.
 In general, finding out whether or not a mixed state is entangled is considered difficult. The general bipartite case has been shown to be  NP-hard . [69]  For the  2 × 2  and  2 × 3  cases, a necessary and sufficient criterion for separability is given by the famous  Positive Partial Transpose (PPT)  condition. [70] 
 
 Reduced density matrices [ edit ] 
 The idea of a reduced density matrix was introduced by  Paul Dirac  in 1930. [71]  Consider as above systems  A  and  B  each with a Hilbert space  H A , H B . Let the state of the composite system be

 . 
 
 
 {\displaystyle |\Psi \rangle \in H_{A}\otimes H_{B}.} 
 
 
 As indicated above, in general there is no way to associate a pure state to the component system  A . However, it still is possible to associate a density matrix. Let

 . 
 which is the  projection operator  onto this state. The state of  A  is the  partial trace  of  ρ T  over the basis of system  B :

 ρ A  is sometimes called the reduced density matrix of  ρ  on subsystem  A . Colloquially, we "trace out" system  B  to obtain the reduced density matrix on  A .
 For example, the reduced density matrix of  A  for the entangled state

 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}\left(|0\rangle _{A}\otimes |1\rangle _{B}-|1\rangle _{A}\otimes |0\rangle _{B}\right),} 
 
 
 discussed above is

 ) 
 
 
 
 {\displaystyle \rho _{A}={\tfrac {1}{2}}\left(|0\rangle _{A}\langle 0|_{A}+|1\rangle _{A}\langle 1|_{A}\right)} 
 
 
 This demonstrates that, as expected, the reduced density matrix for an entangled pure ensemble is a mixed ensemble. Also not surprisingly, the density matrix of  A  for the pure product state

 . 
 In general, a bipartite pure state ρ is entangled if and only if its reduced states are mixed rather than pure.
 
 Two applications that use them [ edit ] 
 Reduced density matrices were explicitly calculated in different spin chains with unique ground state. An example is the one-dimensional  AKLT spin chain : [72]  the ground state can be divided into a block and an environment. The reduced density matrix of the block is  proportional  to a projector to a degenerate ground state of another Hamiltonian.
 The reduced density matrix also was evaluated for  XY spin chains , where it has full rank. It was proved that in the thermodynamic limit, the spectrum of the reduced density matrix of a large block of spins is an exact geometric sequence [73]  in this case.
 
 Entanglement as a resource [ edit ] 
 In  quantum  information theory, entangled states are considered a 'resource', i.e., something costly to produce and that allows to implement valuable transformations. The setting in which this perspective is most evident is that of "distant labs", i.e., two  quantum  systems labeled "A" and "B" on each of which arbitrary  quantum  operations  can be performed, but which do not interact with each other  quantum  mechanically. The only interaction allowed is the exchange of classical information, which combined with the most general local  quantum  operations gives rise to the class of operations called  LOCC  (local operations and classical communication). These operations do not allow the production of entangled states between the systems A and B. But if A and B are provided with a supply of entangled states, then these, together with LOCC operations can enable a larger class of transformations. For example, an interaction between a qubit of A and a qubit of B can be realized by first teleporting A's qubit to B, then letting it interact with B's qubit (which is now a LOCC operation, since both qubits are in B's lab) and then teleporting the qubit back to A. Two maximally entangled states of two qubits are used up in this process. Thus entangled states are a resource that enables the realization of  quantum  interactions (or of  quantum  channels) in a setting where only LOCC are available, but they are consumed in the process. There are other applications where entanglement can be seen as a resource, e.g., private communication or distinguishing  quantum  states. [74] 
 
 Classification of entanglement [ edit ] 
 Not all  quantum  states are equally valuable as a resource. To quantify this value, different  entanglement measures  (see below) can be used, that assign a numerical value to each  quantum  state. However, it is often interesting to settle for a coarser way to compare  quantum  states. This gives rise to different classification schemes. Most entanglement classes are defined based on whether states can be converted to other states using LOCC or a subclass of these operations. The smaller the set of allowed operations, the finer the classification. Important examples are:
 
 If two states can be transformed into each other by a local unitary operation, they are said to be in the same  LU class . This is the finest of the usually considered classes. Two states in the same LU class have the same value for entanglement measures and the same value as a resource in the distant-labs setting. There is an infinite number of different LU classes (even in the simplest case of two qubits in a pure state). [75] [76] 
 If two states can be transformed into each other by local operations including measurements with probability larger than 0, they are said to be in the same 'SLOCC class' ("stochastic LOCC"). Qualitatively, two states  
 
 
 
 
 ρ  ρ

 {\displaystyle \rho _{1}} 
 
  and  
 
 
 
 
 ρ  ρ  
 
 2 
 
 
 
 
 {\displaystyle \rho _{2}} 
 
  in the same SLOCC class are equally powerful (since I can transform one into the other and then do whatever it allows me to do), but since the transformations

 →  →  
 
 ρ  ρ

 {\displaystyle \rho _{2}\to \rho _{1}} 
 
  may succeed with different probability, they are no longer equally valuable. E.g., for two pure qubits there are only two SLOCC classes: the entangled states (which contains both the (maximally entangled) Bell states and weakly entangled states like

 00 
 ⟩  ⟩  
 + 
 0.01 
 
 |

 {\displaystyle |00\rangle +0.01|11\rangle } 
 
 ) and the separable ones (i.e., product states like  
 
 
 
 
 | 
 
 00 
 ⟩  ⟩  
 
 
 {\displaystyle |00\rangle } 
 
 ). [77] [78] 
 Instead of considering transformations of single copies of a state (like

 →  →  
 
 ρ  ρ  
 
 2 
 
 
 
 
 {\displaystyle \rho _{1}\to \rho _{2}} 
 
 ) one can define classes based on the possibility of multi-copy transformations. E.g., there are examples when  
 
 
 
 
 ρ  ρ

 →  →  
 
 ρ  ρ

 {\displaystyle \rho _{1}\otimes \rho _{1}\to \rho _{2}} 
 
  is possible. A very important (and very coarse) classification is based on the property whether it is possible to transform an arbitrarily large number of copies of a state  
 
 
 
 ρ  ρ  
 
 
 {\displaystyle \rho } 
 
  into at least one pure entangled state. States that have this property are called  distillable . These states are the most  useful  quantum  states since, given enough of them, they can be transformed (with local operations) into any entangled state and hence allow for all possible uses. It came initially as a surprise that not all entangled states are distillable, those that are not are called 'bound entangled'. [79] [74] 
 A different entanglement classification is based on what the  quantum  correlations present in a state allow A and B to do: one distinguishes three subsets of entangled states: (1) the  non-local  states , which produce correlations that cannot be explained by a local hidden variable model and thus violate a Bell inequality, (2) the  steerable  states  that contain sufficient correlations for A to modify ("steer") by local measurements the conditional reduced state of B in such a way, that A can prove to B that the state they possess is indeed entangled, and finally (3) those entangled states that are neither non-local nor steerable. All three sets are non-empty. [80]

 In this section, the entropy of a mixed state is discussed as well as how it can be viewed as a measure of  quantum  entanglement.

 As in  statistical mechanics , the more uncertainty (number of microstates) the system should possess, the larger the entropy. For example, the entropy of any pure state is zero, which is unsurprising since there is no uncertainty about a system in a pure state. The entropy of any of the two subsystems of the entangled state discussed above is  log(2)  (which can be shown to be the maximum entropy for  2 × 2  mixed states).
 
 As a measure of entanglement [ edit ] 
 Entropy provides one tool that can be used to quantify entanglement, although other entanglement measures exist. [82]  If the overall system is pure, the entropy of one subsystem can be used to measure its degree of entanglement with the other subsystems.
 For bipartite pure states, the von Neumann entropy of reduced states is the unique measure of entanglement in the sense that it is the only function on the family of states that satisfies certain axioms required of an entanglement measure.
 It is a classical result that the Shannon entropy achieves its maximum at, and only at, the uniform probability distribution {1/ n ,...,1/ n }. Therefore, a bipartite pure state  ρ  ∈  H A  ⊗  H B  is said to be a  maximally entangled state  if the reduced state [ clarification needed ]  of  ρ  is the diagonal matrix

 . 
 
 
 {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}{\frac {1}{n}}&&\\&\ddots &\\&&{\frac {1}{n}}\end{bmatrix}}.} 
 
 
 For mixed states, the reduced von Neumann entropy is not the only reasonable entanglement measure.
 As an aside, the information-theoretic definition is closely related to  entropy  in the sense of statistical mechanics [ citation needed ]  (comparing the two definitions in the present context, it is customary to set the  Boltzmann constant   k  = 1 ). For example, by properties of the  Borel functional calculus , we see that for any  unitary operator   U ,
 
 
 
 
 
 S 
 ( 
 ρ  ρ  
 )

 S

 ρ  ρ  
 
 U 
 
 ∗  ∗  
 
 
 
 ) 
 
 . 
 
 
 {\displaystyle S(\rho )=S\left(U\rho U^{*}\right).} 
 
 
 Indeed, without this property, the von Neumann entropy would not be well-defined.
 In particular,  U  could be the time evolution operator of the system, i.e.,
 
 
 
 
 
 U 
 ( 
 t 
 ) 
 = 
 exp 
 ⁡  ⁡

 ) 
 
 , 
 
 
 {\displaystyle U(t)=\exp \left({\frac {-iHt}{\hbar }}\right),} 
 
 
 where  H  is the  Hamiltonian  of the system. Here the entropy is unchanged.
 The reversibility of a process is associated with the resulting entropy change, i.e., a process is reversible if, and only if, it leaves the entropy of the system invariant.  Therefore, the march of the  arrow of time  towards  thermodynamic equilibrium  is simply the growing spread of  quantum  entanglement. [83] 
This provides a connection between  quantum  information theory  and  thermodynamics .
 Rényi entropy  also can be used as a measure of entanglement.
 
 Entanglement measures [ edit ] 
 Entanglement measures quantify the amount of entanglement in a (often viewed as a bipartite)  quantum  state. As aforementioned,  entanglement entropy  is the standard measure of entanglement for pure states (but no longer a measure of entanglement for mixed states). For mixed states, there are some entanglement measures in the literature [82]  and no single one is standard.
 
 Entanglement cost 
 Distillable entanglement 
 Entanglement of formation 
 Relative entropy of entanglement 
 Squashed entanglement 
 Logarithmic negativity 
 Most (but not all) of these entanglement measures reduce for pure states to entanglement entropy, and are difficult ( NP-hard ) to compute. [84] 
 
 Quantum  field theory [ edit ] 
 The  Reeh-Schlieder theorem  of  quantum  field theory  is sometimes seen as an analogue of  quantum  entanglement.
 
 Applications [ edit ] 
 Entanglement has many applications in  quantum  information theory . With the aid of entanglement, otherwise impossible tasks may be achieved.
 Among the best-known applications of entanglement are  superdense coding  and  quantum  teleportation . [85] 
 Most researchers believe that entanglement is necessary to realize  quantum  computing  (although this is disputed by some). [86] 
 Entanglement is used in some protocols of  quantum  cryptography . [87] [88]  This is because the "shared noise" of entanglement makes for an excellent  one-time pad . Moreover, since measurement of either member of an entangled pair destroys the entanglement they share, entanglement-based  quantum  cryptography allows the sender and receiver to more easily detect the presence of an interceptor. [ citation needed ] 
 In  interferometry , entanglement is necessary for surpassing the  standard  quantum  limit  and achieving the  Heisenberg limit . [89] 
 
 Entangled states [ edit ] 
 There are several canonical entangled states that appear often in theory and experiments.
 For two  qubits , the  Bell states  are

 These four pure states are all maximally entangled (according to the  entropy of entanglement ) and form an  orthonormal   basis (linear algebra)  of the Hilbert space of the two qubits.  They play a fundamental role in  Bell's theorem .
 For M>2 qubits, the  GHZ state  is

 {\displaystyle M=3} 
 
 .  GHZ states are occasionally extended to  qudits , i.e., systems of  d  rather than 2 dimensions.
 Also for M>2 qubits, there are  spin squeezed states . [90]  Spin squeezed states are a class of  squeezed coherent states  satisfying certain restrictions on the uncertainty of spin measurements, and are necessarily entangled. [91]  Spin squeezed states are good candidates for enhancing precision measurements using  quantum  entanglement. [92] 
 For two  bosonic  modes, a  NOON state  is

  except the basis kets 0 and 1 have been replaced with "the  N  photons are in one mode" and "the  N  photons are in the other mode".
 Finally, there also exist  twin Fock states  for bosonic modes, which can be created by feeding a  Fock state  into two arms leading to a beam splitter.  They are the sum of multiple of NOON states, and can used to achieve the Heisenberg limit. [93] 
 For the appropriately chosen measure of entanglement, Bell, GHZ, and NOON states are maximally entangled while spin squeezed and twin Fock states are only partially entangled.  The partially entangled states are generally easier to prepare experimentally.
 
 Methods of creating entanglement [ edit ] 
 Entanglement is usually created by direct interactions between subatomic particles. These interactions can take numerous forms. One of the most commonly used methods is  spontaneous parametric down-conversion  to generate a pair of photons entangled in polarisation. [74]  Other methods include the use of a  fiber coupler  to confine and mix photons, photons emitted from decay cascade of the bi-exciton in a  quantum  dot , [94]  the use of the  Hong–Ou–Mandel effect , etc., In the earliest tests of Bell's theorem, the entangled particles were generated using  atomic cascades .
 It is also possible to create entanglement between  quantum  systems that never directly interacted, through the use of  entanglement swapping .  Two independently-prepared, identical particles may also be entangled if their wave functions merely spatially overlap, at least partially. [95] 
 
 Testing a system for entanglement [ edit ]

 ρ  ρ

 {\displaystyle \displaystyle {\rho =\sum _{j}p_{j}\rho _{j}^{(A)}\otimes \rho _{j}^{(B)}}}

 p

 {\displaystyle 1\geq p_{j}\geq 0} 
 
  probabilities. By definition, a state is entangled if it is not separable.
 For 2-Qubit and Qubit-Qutrit systems (2 × 2 and 2 × 3 respectively) the simple  Peres–Horodecki criterion  provides both a necessary and a sufficient criterion for separability, and thus -inadvertently- for detecting entanglement. However, for the general case, the criterion is merely a necessary one for separability, as the problem becomes  NP-hard  when generalized. [96] [97]  Other separability criteria include (but not limited to) the  range criterion ,  reduction criterion , and those based on uncertainty relations. [98] [99] [100] [101]  See Ref. [102]  for a review of separability criteria in discrete variable systems.
 A numerical approach to the problem is suggested by  Jon Magne Leinaas ,  Jan Myrheim  and  Eirik Ovrum  in their paper "Geometrical aspects of entanglement". [103]  Leinaas et al. offer a numerical approach, iteratively refining an estimated separable state towards the target state to be tested, and checking if the target state can indeed be reached. An implementation of the algorithm (including a built-in  Peres-Horodecki criterion  testing) is  "StateSeparator"  web-app.
 In continuous variable systems, the  Peres-Horodecki criterion  also applies. Specifically, Simon  [104]  formulated a particular version of the Peres-Horodecki criterion in terms of the second-order moments of canonical operators and showed that it is necessary and sufficient for  
 
 
 
 1 
 ⊕  ⊕  
 1 
 
 
 {\displaystyle 1\oplus 1} 
 
 -mode Gaussian states (see Ref. [105]  for a seemingly different but essentially equivalent approach). It was later found  [106]  that Simon's condition is also necessary and sufficient for

 -mode Gaussian states, but no longer sufficient for

 {\displaystyle 2\oplus 2} 
 
 -mode Gaussian states. Simon's condition can be generalized by taking into account the higher order moments of canonical operators  [107] [108]  or by using entropic measures. [109] [110] 
 In 2016 China launched the world’s first  quantum  communications satellite. [111]  The $100m  Quantum  Experiments at Space Scale  (QUESS) mission was launched on Aug 16, 2016, from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northern China at 01:40 local time.
 For the next two years, the craft – nicknamed "Micius" after the ancient Chinese philosopher – will demonstrate the feasibility of  quantum 
communication between Earth and space, and test  quantum  entanglement over unprecedented distances.
 In the June 16, 2017, issue of  Science , Yin et al. report setting a new  quantum  entanglement distance record of 1,203 km, demonstrating the survival of a two-photon pair and a violation of a Bell inequality, reaching a CHSH valuation of 2.37 ± 0.09, under strict Einstein locality conditions, from the Micius satellite to bases in Lijian, Yunnan and Delingha, Quinhai, increasing the efficiency of transmission over prior fiberoptic experiments by an order of magnitude. [112] [113] 
 
 Naturally entangled systems [ edit ] 
 The electron shells of multi-electron atoms always consist of entangled electrons. The correct ionization energy can be  calculated  only by consideration of electron entanglement. [114] 
 
 Photosynthesis [ edit ] 
 It has been suggested that in the process of  photosynthesis , entanglement is involved in the transfer of energy between  light-harvesting complexes  and  photosynthetic reaction centers  where the kinetic energy is harvested in the form of chemical energy. Without such a process, the efficient conversion of optical energy into chemical energy cannot be explained. Using  femtosecond spectroscopy , the coherence of entanglement in the  Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex  was measured over hundreds of  femtoseconds  (a relatively long time in this regard) providing support to this theory. [115] [116] 
However, critical follow-up studies question the interpretation of these results and assign the reported signatures of electronic  quantum  coherence to nuclear dynamics in the chromophores. [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] 
 
 Living systems [ edit ] 
 In October 2018, physicists reported producing  quantum  entanglement using  living organisms , particularly between living  bacteria  and  quantized light . [124] [125] 
 Living organisms (green sulphur bacteria) have been studied as mediators to create  quantum  entanglement between otherwise non-interacting light modes, showing high entanglement between light and bacterial modes, and to some extent, even entanglement within the bacteria. [126]

To avoid such action at a distance they have to attribute, to the space-time regions in question, real properties in advance of observation, correlated properties, which predetermine the outcomes of these particular observations. Since these real properties, fixed in advance of observation, are not contained in  quantum  formalism, that formalism for EPR is incomplete. It may be correct, as far as it goes, but the usual  quantum  formalism cannot be the whole story."

 ^   In the literature "non-locality" is sometimes used to characterize concepts that differ from the non-existence of a local hidden variable model, e.g., whether states can be distinguished by local measurements and which can occur also for non-entangled states (see, e.g.,  Charles H. Bennett, David P. DiVincenzo, Christopher A. Fuchs, Tal Mor, Eric Rains, Peter W. Shor, John A. Smolin, and William K. Wootters (1999). " Quantum  nonlocality without entanglement".  Phys. Rev.
